Sadly, my recent experience with Apple has been nothing short of frustrating. After forgetting my device ID, I found myself locked out of my phone. Despite reaching out to at least ten Apple representatives in my attempts to fix this issue, each conversation left me at a standstill. While every representative maintained impeccable politeness, their collective inability to assist left me dumbfounded. Their kindness, though appreciated, couldn't make up for the lack of effective support. This experience has made me question my decision to switch to Apple, and at the end of my contract I‚Äôll be switching back to Android for all my devices, laptop, phone, and earphones. As it stands, I‚Äôm no closer to getting access to my phone. BEWARE ANYONE LOOKING TO SWITCH\", 'Apple Watch purchased May 2023. Paid extra for a leather magnetic watch strap.

The pricing difference between India and rest of the world is wide of the mark. Does Apple have an explanation for this?', 'I have always loved Apple, their products and customer service. This recent experience returning a product ordered from the apple store has been terrible. Basically I ordered a charger, returned it and it was lost by FedEx.

I placed an order on the store through finance with all the correct details and a month later when it came to delivery, it was the wrong postcode.

So in the end I had to cancel the order. I just don‚Äôt understand why this order was such a shambles.', 'While contacting Apple customer support about the 44% increase in Apple TV+, it brought back the previous incident I had with Apple Support and their lack of action to deal with issues of poor service, App fraud and unjustified price hikes.  Let me explain:I had purchased a one time/life time subscription to TapeACall Pro via Apple App Store. 22 months after purchasing TapeACall, they secretly charged my account $0.00 in order to change the subscription type I had, so that they could begin charging me a monthly fee. I contacted Apple and proved everything I am saying now. They told me they were not responsible, it was the App developer. I contacted the App developer who said I had to contact Apple. I provided emails to Apple to confirm this. Apple then said they are not responsible for what the developers do. I could not understand this at all as Apple is the one who sells the App. If you go to Walmart and buy a lamp that doesn‚Äôt work, you return it to Walmart. Walmart doesn‚Äôt tell you that it‚Äôs not their responsibility to correct this, that it‚Äôs the manufacturer. No other entity, nearly as big, as big, or bigger than Apple, has a policy where they hold no responsibility for what they sell. Apple Support Manager told me to make a review of the App on the App Store, I did - nothing happened. They said leave feedback on their website, I did - nothing happened. This was the senior support manager who was telling me this. Please understand, complaints, feedback and issues are put in a void that provides no response or intent to resolve. So why would anyone purchase anything from the Apple App Store knowing they refuse to be responsible‚Ä¶ the Support Manager even told me there had been a plethora of complaints about this App, yet they kept selling it. If Apple doesn‚Äôt feel they have a fiduciary responsibility to either be responsible or hold the App developer responsible then I suggest Apple shouldn‚Äôt be able to sell anything that is from a third party. Imagine you went to the movies and purchased a drink with unlimited refills, but when you went to get a refill they said you had to pay for it. When you explain, and prove, that you were sold unlimited refills they tell you to contact Coke/Pepsi or leave the complaint on a feedback card (that no one ever looks at). Furthermore, they refuse to give you a refund and they continue selling drinks with unlimited refills that don‚Äôt actually have refills. Would you ever go back to that theatre?So now Apple has raised their Apple+ Tv subscription by 44%, but haven‚Äôt increased new content. In fact their new content has decreased. Additionally, they are now more expensive than Disney+ and Prime Video, but have a fraction of the content. There is no loyalty incentive or even a justification for the price increase. They are banking on being ‚ÄúApple‚Äù and that people will just put up with it. There are many other large companies that thought they were to big to fail - Kodak, Blockbuster, Polaroid, Xerox and so many more. Knowing that inflation has gone up at nearly record levels, Apple has decided now is the time to increase their price - not just increase it at inflation rates, but instead 6 times the pinnacle inflation rate recently experienced. I have cancelled my Apple Subscription,  When it‚Äôs time to upgrade I will be buying an Android device, probably a Samsung or Google phone and will leave Apple in my rear view. In the age of customer experience, a company that has zero respect for the consumer should not expect any loyalty (think about them being caught purposefully slowing down phones in order to prompt consumers to buy a newer model). I‚Äôll end with what I said to the Customer service representative and the Manager; why would I stay with Apple, when I‚Äôm doing way more for Apple than Apple does for me? As my devices age (laptop, wireless headphones, smart watch, tablet), I will replace these devices with other brands. I hope that more consumers who have negative experiences with Apple do the same. It‚Äôs the only way they will change.', \"What kind of so called high end company makes you wait two weeks to recover your apple ID when you recovered with your email multiple times and have the correct password to login?Im on a contract phone and had them for 5 years but they needed two weeks to verify it's me ?

On top of that I'm demolishing my Apple iPhone when I'm done with it instead of selling it or trading it in.  Apple is definitely overrated and I'm glad they did that so I can see there true colors.

In my desperate attempts to resolve this matter, I contacted your support team, who suggested subscribing to a monthly iCloud backup service for a fee of 3 pounds. I complied, thinking this would be the solution to my problems, only to find out that it did not resolve the issue.Upon contacting your support team for the second time, I was recommended to transfer the files via my Mac. To my dismay, this too proved to be futile. I have spent an excruciating 1.5 days trying to achieve what should have been a straightforward task.It wasn't until my fourth contact with your customer support that I was informed that the problem lies with the software on the new phone. This revelation left me utterly frustrated and disappointed. I decided to visit your store with hopes of getting a replacement, but to my astonishment, I was denied the opportunity to thoroughly inspect the replacement device to ensure it was functioning correctly. I left the store empty-handed, having wasted 7 pounds on parking, 10 pounds on fuel, and an additional 3 pounds on iCloud services.This weekend has been a deplorable experience, marred by incompetence and a lack of support.

I elected to purchase the protection plan for the new iPhone 15 Pro Max which was not to be billed to my bank until the said new phone had been activated.  The receipt I received (sent to an old email address; not the current address I put on the order form) only gave an order number and the name of the item I purchased; no shipping address.The expected ship date was given as between 10/09/23 and 10/15/23 (I preordered on 09/15/23).  I received a notification for fraudulent activity from my bank on 10/03/23 because Apple had billed my first protection plan fee even before the phone was even shipped, much less activated.  When I contacted Apple regarding the charge, their only remedy to the problem was to cancel the protection plan and said I had 60 days to reapply after I received the phone.I also received an email (once again to the old email address) on 10/03/23 that my phone was being prepared for shipment and provided a tracking number.  When I tracked it, they had sent it to an old address and not the address I entered on the order form.  Another 45 minutes on the phone with Apple and the representative said he would request an address change to the shipping company.  Another email (yes, you guessed it - sent to the old email address) said they had contacted the shipping company but there was no guarantee that it would actually change.  At that time, the tracking number was showing a delivery date if 10/05/23.  Since then, the tracking only shows ‚ÄúDelay‚Äù or ‚Äú Mechanical Failure‚Äù.  So I guess my phone will float around in China for a while.The entire preorder process was more trouble than it is worth.  Apple clearly needs to pay attention to individual order information and act accordingly.

I joined the queue and checked in with the staff, as per the usual procedure. I specifically requested that they install the screen protector for me. To my astonishment, the employee who checked me in informed me that the screen protector they sell in-store, which they can install, is different from the one I had purchased online. He stated that they couldn't install the one I bought online. This came as a complete surprise, and I asked him what could be done. He suggested they would refund my online purchase and provide me with the in-store screen protector, which they could install. I found it odd that this information was not conveyed online during my purchase, but I agreed to the change.However, what followed was a wait of an excruciating one hour with no progress. I complained multiple times to both the initial employee and other team members, but they repeatedly apologized and asked me to wait. When I arrived at the store, the queue only consisted of me and two others, and when I left, it was still just a few more customers waiting. Meanwhile, I observed many other customers buying phones and getting their screen protectors installed on the spot. My frustration reached its limit, and I demanded my order without the installation. Again, I was asked to wait. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, my order was handed over.To my disbelief, I noticed an installer standing idle for more than 10 minutes after I had received my order. I approached him, hoping to purchase a new screen protector and have it installed, but he informed me that I would have to wait another 20-30 minutes. I couldn't comprehend this, as I had already waited for an hour. He insisted that he had other customers to attend to. This was beyond frustrating.I escalated the issue to the manager, but to my dismay, he echoed the same response. This level of disrespect is utterly unacceptable. I understand that spending $2000 at the Apple Store doesn't make me their most important customer, but why couldn't they simply install the screen protector when I had already waited for an hour, and their installer was just standing idle?This experience is a disgrace to Apple and stands in stark contrast to the sleek and customer-friendly image that their advertisements portray.\", \"I recently had an Apple account with them and it turns out that my 8-year-old little brother, leaving my phone, took it to play and wanting to buy a game, accidentally recharged 200, the truth is that I didn't give any importance to that Then, when I needed those two hundred euros, I asked for a refund, they told me that it had to be to the account with which I made the recharge.

She had a gift card that I was using (with her permission), which limited the choices I had; most new iPads were more expensive, and I opted to try the Apple website that offered refurbished iPads.  Note that this was an official Apple website, not a third-party one.It was a terrible experience, and I would advise anyone to avoid using this site.  I first tried to order an 8th-generation iPad in Space Gray, the color my daughter preferred.  The item was shown as available on the website. The cost was acceptable given the amount of her gift card.  The order appeared to go through, but a day later, I was advised that the order was canceled.  I called Apple and was told that unfortunately the Space Gray was out of stock.  Worse, Apple had put a \"hold\" on the amount of the purchase, and I had to wait for that to clear before I could use the full amount of the gift card again.Forewarned by this experience, I first called Apple to check that the next color choice for this generation of iPad (silver) was in stock.  I was told it was.  Once the hold on the card cleared, I ordered the silver.  Apple accepted the order, and I received an email saying the order was \"in process\" and was projected to be delivered on a certain date.  That date passed without any progress on the order. I then received an email saying that THIS order was canceled.  I called Apple again and was told, again, that the color was out of stock.  Another \"hold\" was placed on the gift card and, as of 2 days after the cancellation, the hold is still in effect, preventing me from buying an iPad somewhere else.I have used Apple products for years and have been very happy with their design and functionality.  However, this experience has undermined my confidence that Apple cares about its customers.  This borders on improper consumer practices.True, my daughter has not lost any money - this would be consumer fraud - but the time and effort I\\'ve spent trying to buy a product that appeared to be available (or was confirmed to be available) on Apple\\'s website was completely wasted, and my daughter still does not have an iPad.Again, I advise you not to expect the Apple refurbished website to be reliable or able to fulfill your orders.', 'Complaint ref; 102090448608 Went into the Apple app to look at the new iPhone 15 pro.

I believe it is essential to provide feedback when customers face issues, in the hope that it can lead to improvements in the future.Recently, I received a small sum of money (less than $100) via the Apple Cash app, which prompted a sudden and unexpected request for extensive personal information verification. This included my name, address, email, the last four digits of my social security number, and then also my full social security number. Understandably, given recent incidents of fraud on another credit card, I was skeptical about providing such sensitive information. Regrettably, my decision to test the system by entering \"123456789\" led to me being locked out of my Apple Cash account.Desperate to resolve the issue, I reached out to Apple Support earlier today, where I spoke with Richard and his supervisor, Alicia. To my disappointment, they informed me that I had been suspended from using Apple Pay, and there was no apparent way to lift this suspension. Furthermore, I learned that I couldn‚Äôt create a new account without using my social security number, a requirement that Apple strictly enforces.I\\'ve noticed a concerning decline in the overall quality of Apple\\'s products and services. iPhones, which were once known for their reliability and innovation, appear to have lost their charm. Similarly, the experience with Apple\\'s services has deteriorated, as evident in my recent ordeal with Apple Cash. This has left me with a sense of dissatisfaction and frustration.Given the aforementioned issues, I\\'ve made the difficult decision to discontinue my use of Apple services and to part with all Apple products I own, including my iPhone, iPad, MacBook, iMac, and Apple TV. It saddens me to take this step, as I have been a long-time Apple customer, but I feel it is necessary to protect my personal information and seek more reliable alternatives.I hope that my feedback can contribute to improving the experiences of other Apple users in the future.

We then tried one of the numbers again and actually managed to speak to someone. We had to ask for them to speak louder as we could barely hear them. Also, it was extremely difficult to understand the lady. We were then told that our address was wrong despite us giving them our address and the parcel arriving. We spelled out the details and strangely, our address was right. We were eventually told that we had only bought the iPad. We had stressed that the package on display was exactly what we needed. We eventually asked for them to collect the package as it was of no value without the keyboard. She explained that it would cost another two hundred pounds for the keyboard. She then put us through to someone else as she was an engineer. Eventually, it was agreed for Apple to send us labels and we would arrange it collected from our home. We would have to wait until the item reached their factory and was checked before any refund. This would take another 3-5 days to refund. Terrible service all round.

I don\\'t have any Apple products or services and no accessible accounts so couldn\\'t understand the charge.The only thing I can think is that I signed up for EE Broadband and Mobile some time ago. EE completely messed up so I cancelled under the 14 day cooling of period. Part of the EE offer was free Apple TV or Music (I can\\'t remember which) for X number of months. I took advantage of this offer for maybe two days, until I cancelled the EE services. Upon cancelling the EE services I also lost access to the Apple TV or Music. I am assuming that Apple mistakenly thought I was still on a free trial that has now expired and that this was a valid charge??After losing access I never gave it another thought until the charge occurred on my credit card.After the charge occurred, I found the only valid Apple account I had was one where my phone number was the username. Every time I tried to log in with that username, Apple wanted me to change the username to an email address and every time I entered one Apple said \"an error has occurred and wouldn\\'t let me go any further. But I could see, but couldn\\'t change or access, that that account had access to my credit card (I could see the last four digits). There was nothing else I could do - I couldn\\'t log-in and therefore I couldn\\'t see any orders or charges and I couldn\\'t cancel or change anything.I\\'d had no prior notification of the charges and as far as I could ascertain this was daylight robbery - someone had taken my money without my permission. A blatant THIEF and it was APPLE. I contacted Apple by chat and explained everything. I thought it went well and I was understood. However, next I receive an email from Apple saying I understand you have an issue with iTunes! iTunes was never discussed  on chat and it was here that I thought this was going to end badly. Despite what was explained on chat, about the account username, they even requested the following:‚Ä¢ The exact issue description and relevant order numbers (if applicable)‚Ä¢ Your valid Apple ID email addressNeither of which I could supply.I replied to this email, attaching a transcript of the chat, and I have heard nothing back. I have since replied for a second time asking what is happening and I have still heard nothing. It seems I am being ignored on purpose.Apple, illegally, stole ¬£6.99 off me and I want it back. I also want confirmation that they won\\'t be trying to charge me anymore and that they have closed down all my inaccessible accounts. I don\\'t have any need for their products and services and after this is resolved, I don\\'t want anything to do with them ever again.I have had to cancel my credit card over this and have had to lodge a complaint with my CC provider over this unauthorised transaction as Apple have not assisted at all.I have upset my managers at work over this by refusing to use the ¬£800 iPad Pro they have just given me and five other colleagues for a project. All six iPads are now being returned and being replaced with Samsung tablets. This has given me immense satisfaction because it is now reached a corporate level, even if I never get my ¬£6.99 back.I partly blame EE for this mess won\\'t ever use EE or Apple ever again.

The machine is so hot that it bothers me to hold it in my hand, the technology released is just outdated. If the company feels self-respecting, it shouldn't sell phones anymore, before the company can do the simplest things with consumer demand. If it's just to scam consumers, the company is very successful, but I hope one day soon the apple will crumble and users will turn away from it. I used to appreciate apple products very much. I buy most of the products when the apple comes out.

I learned only in 2020 (not from Apple contacting me upfront, but from being contacted by an attorney associated with a class action settlement) that my computer was covered under the terms of a repair program to address a design flaw with the \"butterfly keyboard\" that caused keys to become stuck and/or unresponsive (Apple has since discontinued the butterfly keyboard for this reason). I then called Apple Support, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, and confirmed that my computer\\'s serial number was among those covered. I requested a mail in repair, but was told that I needed to bring it into the store because the repair was not eligible for shipping. I said I was not willing to take it to the store at the risk of my health (this was still pre-vaccine, when nearly everyone was doing their best to stay inside), and so I offered to pay the cost of shipping. I was told I still could not do this, and needed to take it into the store. This made me feel like Apple was adopting a tactic to reduce the likelihood of people actually getting their repair done -- and therefore, to reduce Apple\\'s costs -- which bothered me and reduced my trust in Apple. However, I was told on that same phone call that because my device was covered, I was covered in perpetuity and could bring my device in for repair in the future whenever I felt comfortable doing so. So I accepted the situation, and decided to wait until the Covid emergency was declared over to bring it in again.Fast forward to today, June 27, 2023, less than two months after the federal government declared an end to the pandemic emergency (May 5). I took my computer to the Apple Store in St. Louis Galleria to get the faulty keyboard fixed, and after hearing my problem, the \"genius\" pulled up an Apple website and told that me the program had ended and that my computer could no longer be fixed. I explained the circumstances above -- that I had been promised a fix at whatever point I felt comfortable, and that the problem itself was the result of acknowledged faulty design by Apple -- and asked that an exception be made to cover the repair. They told me at the Apple Store that they could not (Genius bar manager) and would not (store manager) make an exception, and told me Customer Support could. I called Customer Support this evening, spoke to a senior advisor, explained the situation, and he, too, told me that not only could he not make an exception, he could not refer me to anyone who could, and that the repair would not be covered under any circumstances.I have been buying Apple products only for nearly 25 years. When I got married, I started buying them for my wife. When I had a child, I started buying them for my daughter. Over this time, I have seen the quality of Apple products decline and its \"it just works\" software become less functional and intuitive, but I have stuck with Apple because of brand loyalty and because Apple has generally fixed problems in good faith when something went wrong. In this case, that good faith has disappeared and been replaced by what I consider cynical bad faith, with several levels of Apple employees providing wrong information and refusing (or being unable) to take accountability and initiative for a product that was flawed upon purchase, and which the company had already committed to fix at my convenience.The bottom line is that I\\'m stuck with a broken computer that was doomed to fail when I first took it out of the box. If this sounds fair to you, by all means buy Apple, as I have for a quarter century. If not, join me in buying elsewhere, as I plan to do from here on out.', 'THIS COMPANY REGULARLY BREACHES THE AGREEMENT WITH THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN 2010 WITH COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACCC, AND ACL LAWS AND LEGISLATIONS.I HAVE DONE THEM FOUR TIMES IN COURT IN AUSTRALIA AND NOW I AM ON A THE BIGGEST REPORT SOME 700 PAGES OF EVIDENCE AND BREACHES OF OUR ACCC AND AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAWS.1.

I took it back to the site where I purchased it and I was told I needed an ESIEM and the physical SIEM was causing the issues. A week after that the phone screen turned green with lines down it then went completely black. I called Apple who lied to me and said they were sending a loaner until it was repaired. I received nothing not even a box to send the phone in. I then called them back to have them make an appointment at the nearest Apple Store which is an hour away and when I left work early to drive all the way there they set the appointment up for a shopping appointment not a repair appointment so I was sent on my way. I called again to set another appointment and this time they found a Best Buy that was 7 minutes from my house. I again left work early to drive there to be told they can‚Äôt help me because they phone needs to be sent in and there is a mail in ticket already open as they failed to cancel it. So I was once again sent away. I called back in again to talk about my options to get this phone repaired and they refused to talk to me as my minor daughters iCloud account is in her name. Completely ridiculous as the phone is in my name and I pay for it. We got that resolved and they mailed me a box to send the phone in. They repaired it to send it back for it to have the same issue shortly after. I had to call to send it back in for a second time for the same issue. Within a month it was doing the same thing again. This time when I called in they said if it does the same thing after the third repair I will get a replacement phone. Well they will not fix the phone as they are claiming it now has water damage which is absolutely not true and if it does did not come from my end. The customer service person I talked to after calling in when I received the email claiming this agreed it was very strange they didn‚Äôt see water damage the first or second time they opened the phone but rather the third time and it has hit the year mark of owning the phone so there no longer are any warranties etc. They refused to help me and refused to let me talk to a manager and disconnected the call. I then emailed the CEO, CFO AND COO of Apple for neither of them to reach out but someone from their office to reach out. He claimed he was going to investigate this issue and get back to me. I asked him what I should do about the phone as I was unsure what would happen if I didn‚Äôt answer them about what to do with the phone. He said there should be a date that I have to answer by which was not specified anywhere on the email that I screenshot for him. He said he extended the time frame so I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry until this issue was resolved. A few days later I received an email from them saying they were sending the phone back to me I not repaired. I reached back out explaining my concern and he said he extended it so he was unsure as to why that happened. He then explained I would have an answer by the end of the week as to what the outcome will be. He reached back out two days later and told me they will not be replacing the phone as the technician shown there was water damage and disregarded everything else. When I asked him to speak with someone higher than him as he seemed to not care either he told me I could not speak to anyone else as he was assigned to the case and this is the final result. Apple is the absolute worst and they are very sad people to treat customers the way they do by lying to them, hanging up on them, not resolving any of their issues, as well as not acting if they got ripped off or taken care of.

I strongly urge you to reconsider purchasing any Apple product or Apple Care within the country. The level of service provided is abysmal, to say the least, and it is disheartening to witness the complete lack of accountability, especially when it comes to warranty claims.Let me provide you with an account of my own ordeal. Despite my AirPods Pro being well within the warranty period and experiencing a manufacturing issue, the service center deliberately delayed addressing the problem until the warranty had expired. It has been a relentless battle since April, continuously following up with them, only to be met with empty promises and a complete disregard for proper tracking and skilled technicians. Astonishingly, major cities lack dedicated Apple service centers, and instead, rely on third-party facilities. Even if your product is under warranty, don't expect a replacement, as you would in the US or UK.Adding insult to injury, the treatment received from Apple's service personnel is utterly disrespectful, as if owning a premium product does not warrant attention or respect. It bewilders me that there seems to be a lack of a proper tracking mechanism within Apple's international care system. It appears that no matter the exorbitant amount one may spend on an Apple product in India, even if it requires repairs the very next day or if a manufacturing defect arises, one might as well consider it a lost cause. Offering them a year for service or expecting a replacement is futile.If you happen to be reading this, I implore you to heed my words and refrain from purchasing an Apple product in India. I have personally suffered the consequences of my hard-earned money going to waste. I encourage you to explore various forums on Apple in India, where you will find countless individuals grappling with similar issues regarding Apple's service standards. Unless you manage to escalate your concerns to Apple's international care team, the situation in India is unlikely to change.

Lately, I have been disappointed with the level of service provided. One of the main reasons for this is the communication with non-native English-speaking workers, which often leads to confusion and unclear instructions.As a long-time customer of Apple, I have experienced a higher standard of service in the past. The instructions used to be clearer, and the staff was more adept at addressing my questions and concerns. Unfortunately, it seems that the quality of customer service in this regard has declined.I hope that Apple takes steps to ensure smoother communication with customers and provides clearer instructions in the future. This would certainly help regain customer trust and satisfaction.Overall, I am disappointed with my recent experiences with Apple EU, and I hope to see improvements in their service quality moving forward.', 'I finally bought a Mac Book after years of Microsoft laptops and it was \\'ok\\' until I forgot my password and had to try recovery.

I lost the charging case for my Airpods Pro 2 yesterday. Alternatively I tried to charge my Airpods Pro 2 in the charging case of my older Airpods Pro 1. That didn't work. So I went to the Apple store in Amsterdam today to buy a new charging case for my Airpods Pro 2. They needed the serial number. But after checking my bluetooth connection on my phone for the Airpods Pro 2, the customer support employees discovered that this was the exact same serial number as from my Airpods Pro 1. The fact that I tried to charge my Airpods Pro 2, in the charging case of my Airpods Pro 1, automatically changed the serial number of the Airpods Pro 2 on my iPhone, to the serial number of the Airpods Pro 1. The customer support insisted that they needed the serial number before I could buy a new charging case. But there was no way for them to find that serial number. I called with Bol.com, where I bought the Airpods 2. They also could not tell me what the serial number is. I have the original receipt from Bol.com, but that also does not mention the serial number. The 2 serial numbers from the Left and Right Airpods Pro 2 itself, were still visible on my iPhone. But the customer support said they could not use those serial numbers to find the serial number from charging box, because the charging box has a separate serial number. So I asked them how are we going to resolve this. I need a new charging case, otherwise I cannot use my Airpods Pro 2, and I need them for work next week. They refused to sell me a charging case. They kept repeating that they need that serial number. The serial number I don't have. Because Apple changes the serial number on my iPhone if I put the Airpods in another charging case. How was I suppose to know that. Half of the employees of the 'Genius Bar' did not know that. Then the manager tried to put the blame in my shoes, that I would been better if I made the purchase with them directly, and not with Bol.com (one of the biggest retailers in NL) + that I should not have put the Airpods Pro 2 in the Airpods Pro 1 charging case. Even half of their Genius Bar support staff was unaware of this fact. How was I suppose to know this, they look exactly the same! I said that I wanted to hear a solution from them. That just saying we cannot help you is not a solution. They offered me a minor discount on a new set of Airpods, which costs ~300 euro. Instead of a new charging case, which cost 120 euro. Totally unacceptable. It is the extreme arrogance and complete unwillingness to find a suitable solution for a customer that really sticks. They think they can be really arrogant and give dreadful service because they have a monopoly. I just looked Apple up here on Truspilot, to see what other people's experiences are with Apple. They get a 1-star rating from 70% of reviews; +5.000 1-star reviews in total. No reactions from Apples staff on the complaints there. They don't see the need. That says it all I think.

We contacted both Apple and UPS but both parties kept kicking the ball and no one take the case into serious investigation. Apple refused to refund me the money. Both parties caused me so much stress and anxiety without doing anything to protect their consumer. I lost $1800.00 and left with fury. I shared the story on Facebook page of my neighborhood.

What a nightmare! There is a chaos with the apple account that nobody seems to be able to solve. I have already spoken with two customer assistants for HOURS on the phone, I am talking to a manager, Ilay, however you write it, right now but he apparently can\\'t solve the problem either. The original problem was that I keep on getting this pop up saying that I have a virus. More than two hours afterwards, we had to change both the passwords of my laptop and Apple ID. We managed to change the one for my laptop but my Apple ID was unsuccessful. And then is when the true nightmare began.I went to the shop directly and spoke to the \"Genius\" technician. At some point I know that he changed some password somewhere, I don\\'t know where or why, but he put apple just as the password somewhere, and he left it at that. I WASTED all Sunday in the shop, but I couldn\\'t stay there for so long, oh no. Apple doesn\\'t want frustrated and unhappy customers in the shop-they might put off other customers. Of course not, even when they are being absolutely incompetent at problems they created. So I had to spend one hour waiting in the mall doing nothing until I could come back so that the guy tried to recover the password once again. By the way, while this Genius guy was at it, he changed all the settings: no alarms for some reason, the light on my screen turned off for some reason, so I had to call AGAIN so that another person helped me to put everything right again. Anyway, it didn\\'t work again, so I had to wait almost a month to get a six digit thing sent to my phone and recover my apple account. Did it work today? Oh, no. Of course not. So I called again customer services. Somebody called Ilay who said he was a manager was giving me instructions, but half the time I didn\\'t even know what password he was talking about, what he was describing. The guy looked bored as hell, but I was not bored, I was angry and upset. In the end he was no help at all and clueless. He is puzzled why the system keeps on asking me for a password of a different computer that I never had. So I cannot have any updates, so my personal and banking data is going to be at risk more and more. This is my first computer and I can tell you right now that is going to be the last.In the end, according to this guy, it\\'s all my fault, because I don\\'t know all my previous passwords. Who is going to remember old, changed passwords? What am I supposed to remember those? When you change passwords, the old ones get invalidated. But not with Apple, and somehow this is all my fault, according to Manager Ilya that has not helped at all. But not with Apple. They wanted me to remember old passwords to see if one of them works. Meanwhile, there is no solution: I am still being pestered with virus warnings and the what not, I cannot get updates, the system is asking me for passwords for \\'the other computer\\' that doesn\\'t exist and never existed and Apple couldn\\'t care less. If anybody is thinking about changing to an apple phone or laptop, I would recommend them to stick with Windows.

On returning home, I discovered the phone was exactly as before going to Apple. Called Apple on day 10, and they agreed to send a replacement. The process of sending the phone back and getting a replacement was a stressful week because of the subcontractors Apple are using: Collecting the phone, nowhere on the paperwork said it was Apple, and all the printed references were theirs. Even the tracking number was for delivery of the label and not for tracking the phone back to them. They only acknowledged they received the phone after I managed to contact them and complain. On the 19th of May, Apple was telling me they had processed my order, and the replacement would be with me on 16 May (three days before!)After all that time wasted for both Apple and me and the cost that Apple incurred, the new phone is defective, exactly as the first was!As I see it, Apple products are made glossy outside, but it\\'s Chinese crap inside.

I need my iphone to keep track of what is happening to my blood sugars and then suddenly a good battery percentage reduces to 1% and the phone then shuts itself off leaving me not knowing what is going on inside my body.It personally feels like they kill off old products on purpose with these updates to force you to update your product and spend more money with them.For a company that is so big, you would expect better.\", \"Currentlyw, I am using iPhone 11 got update 14.3.1 last year after that I am not able to send text messages due to that unable to use banking app. Talk to senior representative more that 300 times but they don't have any solution.

Apple advised me at the start of this that if this is the case (that the MacBook is lost) that they will provide a new one. Apple however has no interest in getting it done, and every time they call they say no update, and I need it for work. I have had it confirmed to me three times over the last 8 days by UPS.

I have been told by Apple that they would contact the security officer at UPS to verify the information I gave them. They haven't (confirmed to me by both UPS and then, on questioning, Apple).So they lie, and then refuse to their job.

I saw that the financing option was available and since I have successfully used it in the past, I went into the shop to buy my new watch with financing. The lovely customer assistant informed me that you cannot buy a watch in the shop with financing, but she offered to do it on one of the available laptops. Unfortunately, it didn't work (some problem with the internet or sth) and she advised to do it at home. I went home and had to cancel the first order attempt and redo it, as you cannot pick up where you left off. I did so successfully and had the financing approved in seconds. A day later Apple says that the order is being processed with an estimated delivery date a month later! After contacting the online customer care they explained that they couldn't do anything to expedite the order, although they understood my frustration. I can understand a delivery date of up to a week, but a month?! This is ridiculous, especially considering that there is no clear information about the length of delivery when you choose financing! If I wanted to cancel and just go and buy it in the shop in cash, I would have to talk to the financing partner and Apple separately of course, which take a long time too.  This review doesn't reflect the experience I've had from the face-to-face and online customer service, as they have been excellent despite having their hands tied up by the idiotic Apple policies.\", 'Pointless !!

At first, the issue was sporadic, but it quickly escalated to a point where it became unbearable. After researching online, I discovered that this was a widespread issue affecting all models featuring the 'new butterfly type keyboard' introduced in 2015. This keyboard has caused a lot of problems, especially regarding the issue I encountered. A quick search online reveals endless complaints, and it's gotten so bad that Apple has officially acknowledged the problem and created a fix, in addition to settling a $50 million dollar class action claim for the very same issue.When I went to the Apple Genius Bar at Chadstone, I met with Dave, who visually and physically examined my MacBook Pro and suggested that the issue was  probably some dirt stuck under the key. But after five minutes, Dave returned with a wry smile and told me that the key was broken. He quickly added that it would be too expensive to fix at AUD$1000 and it wasn't worth it. The key was no longer stuck, but it was broken. I confronted Dave, and he said that all he did was blow compressed air under the key.I spoke to the store manager and asked him to review the CCTV footage of our interactions. After seeing it, he agreed with everything I claimed. But, he maintained that all Dave did was wipe the keyboard with a cloth and blow compressed air. I asked the manager if he agreed that the H key looked damaged and broken, sitting lower than any other key on the keyboard, and he said it did. So, I asked why Dave didn't identify it during the initial inspection. The manager then offered to split the damage bill 50/50, but I declined and reported the issue to Apple directly the next day.Apple Australia responded, but their response was disappointing. They sided with the Apple Store staff regarding this matter. It's frustrating to encounter such a widespread known issue, and even more disappointing to receive such an unsatisfactory response from Apple Genius Chadstone, refusing to take responsibility for making my initial well publicised butterfly keyboard fault claim  null and void by completely breaking the keyboard and leaving me in the hole with at least a $500 repair bill which they kindly accepted a partial responsibility for their negligence.

We will factory reset your phone should fix the issue. All that did was erase my passwords. The battery health was still 89%. I asked the guy since it‚Äôs less than a year can I get a new battery? He replied sorry we don‚Äôt replace the battery till it‚Äôs under 80%. He also said if it gets under 80% before the warranty expires then they will fix it otherwise it is 100.00.

This last batch which consisted of the latest iPhone, new iPad, and a new MacBook pro 14 inch is way below the standard that was in the past.  Then I called to renew my apple care on the MackBook Pro and asked if I was still eligible.  The girl told me I had thirty days from expiration to renew it.  I wanted to renew that day but when she put me on hold it took too long and a business appointment I had had to be tended to.  I finally had to hang up but wasn\\'t concerned because I had 30 days.  Today I took the time with no appointments waiting to call and renew and was told I wasn\\'t eligible.  I advised that an apple employee had advised I had 30 days and I relied on that assurance.  Basically the reply was sorry.  Kind of \"so sad too bad\".  There is nothing special currently wrong with the computer other than less than the quality and workability of the past but the care plan seems more important than ever.

I had a couple of browser tabs open and went for a cup of coffee. When I got back to my desk the screen was black with no indication of what was going on.So I pull out my trusty hundred dollar Raspberry PI (which has been more reliable than any Apple built computer I have ever owned) and start looking into what could have gone wrong.It turns out that many people have had the same issue. Have a look at Louis Rossman‚Äôs YouTube Video : ‚ÄúHow MOST 16\" Macbook Pros often kill themselves & why they\\'re unfixable‚Äù. I contact Apple directly, provide the details of my machine. Which was just out of warranty. I wanted to know if my specific model (A2141)  is on a recall list and if not, why not? I requested that the issue be escalated and I was put through to somebody more senior. Only to be made to feel like the problem is me. Which I took exception to because I know how to look after my equipment. It seems I should have realised that a premium Apple Mac Book Pro requires extra EXTRA special care and if I sneeze in its presence it might die. I am running and have run several other devices within the same environment. Apple is always the problem child when it comes to hardware! Apple then proceeds to tell me that my hardware failure was an isolated incident. We wrapped up the call with her promising to follow up in the next couple of days. I received an email that asked me to provide any additional information I would like to add. So I sent her the link to the video mentioned above. I have had no response to the email and Apple has not called me back as promised.I then take the machine into an Apple Authorised Ripoff Center. Where it is evident that their policy from the start is to replace, no attempt to repair. And because all the components are soldered onto the Logicboard‚Ä¶ not only do I have to fork out an obscene amount of money to have it REPLACED, I will also lose my data. Long story short, I spoke to the shop who originally sold me the MacBook Pro. They mentioned there is a possibility that they could fix it. And they did!‚Ä¶ not only that, I did NOT lose any data!!!! Bottom line: Apple quoted USD 2900 to replace the MLB.. with DATA LOSS.By avoiding Apple\\'s way of doing business, the repair cost USD 300 with NO DATA LOSS  !!Now I just need to put this sleek high-end mobile device on a special desk, encase it in an air conditioned glass case and keep it off grid with its own dedicated power source. Then maybe, just maybe it wont decide to kill itself again for no apparent reason.The industry should be more regulated. Depending on these devices, that are clearly not reliable, can have an adverse affect on many aspects of our lives, including our ability to communicate with the world around us and what we put into our rice bowls. It\\'s VERY clear that Apple do NOT have the best interests of their customers in mind. Not to mention the wellbeing of the planet. But I am pretty sure that the bank balances of all the chiefs, execs and shareholders are in very good shape.It‚Äôs a disgrace that Apple gets away with this!_', 'Might just switch to android.

This is a huge issue for me being in sales. I called and the first person from India was very helpful and showed me how to turn it off. I am writing a one-star review however for the following: Turning off the feature that transcribes voicemails into text also turned off the microphone on Whatsapp, messenger and text messages. That is a really inept software design issue. If someone wants to turn off transcription of voicemails into text so that they come thru faster, why would it also be tied to being able to use the microphone for voice to text on Whatsapp, messenger and messages? Those are two entirely different things.  The second issue and main reason for the one-star review is the second Apple advisor I got when I called back. This hasn\\'t been the first time I called and got a fanatical, almost Nazi Zealot Zombie type advisor that wouldn\\'t listen to me and what I was asking and saying and just kept saying the microphone issue was due to my iPhone being one software update behind and not due to the feature the other advisor had me turn off just ten minutes prior. I kept asking if there was a work around to keep the microphone for texting on whilst turning off the voicemail to text feature and he kept being degrading asking me \" if my doctor told me to do something if I would do it\" and to do the software update. Then he hung up on me when I said I felt like he wasn\\'t listening and giving me bad service.  So, I hope Apple reads this. You need to understand your products, like all products, have flaws and are not perfect and you need to fire and get rid of these zealot advisors that belittle your customers.

I went back to school because I was in a rush, and BOOM my computer was in the same black-screened state. I went back five days later, and another worker - Will - sent it to see if it could get replaced under some \"quality program\" for free and if they found no issues, it would be replaced similarly to a \"recall\". Two days later, I get an email saying hardware issues were suddenly found and I was asked to pay $500 to repair it. Why I found that suspicious is because, I have a case on the laptop, around the laptop, and it is in my backpack. Mind you, it is the heaviest item in my backpack and I do not drop or throw my backpack around. Went back to the Apple store and the same guy - Will - suggested to not get it fixed and rather replace it. Oh of course, so that you can get more money. I called Apple Support to get further, in depth details as to why my computer was damaged. Talked to an Advisor - Joe - and he escalated me to a Senior Advisor - Lance - to talk to. Whenever I asked Lance for what the specific issues were, he was indirect, unclear, and unhelpful. I had a friend also ask questions, and magically, he pulls out a random hardware issue when he could have said that from the get go. There was nothing that could be done on their part (apparently). We had a Senior Advisor repeating the same four words the entire conversation and saying that I had to pay HALF the price I bought the computer for to repair it when there was no CLEAR issue that could have been caused by me.

Apple store‚Äôs application has repeatedly hidden reviews of apps when I have pointed out that an app (like instagram) is censoring women who say things like woman equals adult human female, or that women are not ideas in a man‚Äôs head, fetish, costume, skin perforations, or vibes, while that same app will allow imagery of child exploitation like kiddiesnuff, such as halfnude children gasping in plastic bags and tied halfnude to beds with legs splayed, with instagram claiming this is allowable art. Even if I smash keywords together that might trigger an algorithm in order to avoid the algorithm, these reviews that criticize a platform‚Äôs censorship of women and endorsement of the erosion of child safegaurding are removed from public view. So Apple does not allow genuine reviews. You can criticize that same app for racism, but Apple does not want the public to become aware of the scale of discrimination against women and exploitation of children. So I have noticed that over and over again, those two key topics are not allowed to publicly post in Apple‚Äôs app store reviews. Therefore Apple is colluding with the kiddie cutting cult, and crafting the appearance of our social compliance with this exploitation campaign. They do this even as Paypal, Youtube, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, and Twitter bans women who push back against erasure, and recently Apple blocked the app Telegram across all devices which allows censored citizens to speak and share news, citations, stats, and resources without the censorship of digital marketers purging dissidents.

After a few months, the case began falling apart and the phone would literally fall out of the case.  I contacted Apple, which is an unbelievably difficult task to accomplish.  They initiated a case number and warranty claim.  This resulted in me being passed between 6 reps and hours on hold.  All the while each rep promised me that the case would be replaced and they would make sure the problem was resolved.  Eventually, after 4 days of back and forth they connected me to a guy that says he has resolved the problem and all I need to do is start over and go elsewhere as Apple has absolutely zero responsibility for their own product failures.  Even though they lured me into buying it, took the money and profit and maintained the relationship, now they drop the ball completely.  Of course I can always try to contact the original manufacturer but why promise me so much and waste so much of my time only to conclude that their customer service department is a complete waste of space?

I was very happy until, out of the blue, it failed completely on 14th December 2022 in the middle of a Teams call. I was not able to restart it. I contacted Apple who ran through some basic diagnostics and advised me to take it to an authorised repairer. I was told that my iMac was out-of-warranty as it was more that 1 year old, the implication being that I would need to pay for a repair.I delivered it to an iStore in Guildford on 16th December 2022.On the 20th December 2022 the iStore informed me that in addition to the ¬£90 diagnostic fee I had already paid I would need to pay ¬£475 for a new Logic Board.This seemed outrageous for a product that was 18-months old. On reviewing my rights as a consumer I wrote to Apple. The letter included the following:The Consumer Rights Act 2015 makes it an implied term of the contract I have with Apple that goods be as described, fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality.As you are in breach of contract and I've owned the product between 6 months and 6 years, I am within my statutory rights to ask for it to be repaired.The reply came back that I had sent this to the wrong place in Apple and I should contact Apple Care.22 December 2022 - I speak to an advisor - John - who assures me he will take ownership and resolve the issue for me. He sounds very uncertain and hesitant when he learns that I am referencing consumer rights law to require Apple to pay for the repair. However, he eventually gives the iStore the go-ahead to complete the repair. He sends me a link to a site that allows me to leave a message and /or voicemail for him if I need further help.6 January 2023 - iStore inform me that they have tried various ways to fix the iMac but nothing works. They are at a loss as to how to repair it. I contact John via the link he has sent me but get no response.8 January 2023 - I call Apple Support and speak to Daniela who assures me she understands how frustrating this is and she will now take ownership of the case and resolve my issue. At this stage I ask for a like-for-like replacement of the iMac since it appears to be impossible to repair. She needs to talk to another department in Apple to see if this can be done but as they do not work on weekends cannot progress it further. She promises to call me the next day.9 January 2023 - Daniela calls and says that she has confirmed with the iStore that they do not know how to repair it. She tells me that I need to collect the faulty iMac from the iStore and when I have it to let her know so that she can see if the machine can be replaced. When I question why I need to collect it to send to them rather than have the iStore send it to them and why she could not guarantee that it would be exchanged, her response was that this is how we do things and there can be no deviation from that.10 January 2023 - I call the iStore to arrange to collect the faulty iMac the following day.11 January 2023 - The iStore text me to say that they are not sure that they can have the iMac reassembled in time to collect that day. I contact Apple Support to express my frustration with the process. I speak to Paulo who assures me he understands my frustration and that he will now take ownership and resolve my problem. When I insist that I need progress on the replacement he proceeds to process a like-for-like replacement order even though I do not yet have the iMac in my possession. He asks me to ensure the iStore repair order completion is sent to him stating that the device is not repairable. While talking to him a text comes through telling me that the iMac is ready for collection from the iStore. I pick up the faulty iMac and the iStore immediately volunteer a refund of the ¬£90 diagnostic fee (well done iStore!) and send me the repair order completion.

I walked in to purchase a new iPhone 14 pro Nov 30th 2022 where the following took place:Your Apple employee advised me that there were no iPhone 14 pro‚Äôs available in stock and that I would have to reserve one by adding my name to a reservation list. The iPhone 14 pro would only arrive on December 28th. Unfortunately, this date would not work as I was scheduled to leave the country December 16, 2022. To my surprise, the employee proceeded to advise me that since I would be out of country Dec 28th, he could NOT add me to the reservation list.I proceeded to search the mall at all electronic stores who are licensed to sell Apple products/iPhone in attempt to locate said iPhone. With no luck, and no choice quite frankly, I started looking for iPhones in the online market. I located one on Facebook marketplace from an individual selling a brand-new iPhone boxed with receipt of purchase. This seemed legitimate, however, to be cautious and prior to completing this transaction, I phoned the Apple store at Yorkdale mall. This is where I spoke to an employee who verified the purchase based on the information on the receipt. The seller‚Äôs reason for selling was that ‚Äúhis father wasn‚Äôt an iPhone guy‚Äù. Your Apple employee assured and verified that this iPhone in question was in fact real according to the serial number and information on its receipt. However, once the transaction and exchange took place, I got home and quickly attempted to sync my iPhone with this new one only to learn that I had been scammed and this was a fake iPhone.Not only am I annoyed that I wasted a morning getting inaccurate information, being turned away by an Apple employee, but in turn due to my time constraints, I looked at other options one being to purchase an iPhone online (from a con artist).My impression of Apple has been tarnished, and I am now considering getting rid of all Apple products. I have been a loyal customer for over 15 years! My whole family has iPhones, iPhone watches, iPads, Apple desktop and laptops (including my businesses). Furthermore, your customer service representative gave inaccurate information when in fact I came to find out that Apple receives iPhones every two days if you walk in during shipment days you have an opportunity to get one (alternative to being put on the reservation list). Had I known this information, I would have made a more informed decision and gladly returned to purchase my new iPhone with confidence at an Apple store. Your service representative‚Äôs inability to provide accurate information has caused me duress, incurred expense relating to $1500 lost to a fake iPhone & now also a lost loyal customer. I would like to note that I have contacted police to file a report and they are unable to assist in these online fraud instances.I trust this is not the way Apple wishes to conduct business with valued customers‚ÄîI have been with you for many years and have never encountered such treatment before.

I called tonight to see if they would finally come through on the commitment. However, after two dropped calls (after being on hold about 45 minutes each call) and finally getting through on the 3rd call they still are unwilling to honor their commitment. They are now saying that it looks like the subscription was signed up for during the one-year period so I am no longer eligible. I told them tonight, as I have on every call, that I was unable to access the subscription. However, they said that they see in their notes that it looks like I signed up for the subscription and had it available - absolutely not true. Tonight after over 30 minutes I'm talking to a manager from Apple named Leonard. At the end of the call he said that he can forward a complaint on my behalf, but it's unlikely that anyone from Apple will follow up and contact me.

The new Senior agent said she would look at the case and get back to me.

They have created multiple things that require multiple sign-ins and instead of making using an electronic device easier, it makes it a genuine hassel.

I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max with 1T storage since September 2001. I have been using iPhone Notes quite a while to store all my important notes such as passwords and important messages. It has been accumulated hundreds of notes over the year. It was pretty handy until a couple of days ago it suddenly disappeared! All of them! I did not do anything such as deleting or grouping etc. I was crazy about this lost as I can‚Äôt do my normal work without those Notes records. I looked up from internet to try to get some tips to retrieve them back. I‚Äôve tried all the methods suggested without success. I realised that my notes were not stored in either of my iCloud or my outlook account because both of these accounts were full and could not take sync from my iPhone. So I think all my notes were stored locally in my iPhone. I went to a few mobile phone shops and was told there is no way to recover those lost data. I called Apple technical support and was given 3 other data recovery companies. I tried again without any success. By looking up from Internet for more information, I can see quite a few people had these problems before. But very strange that they did not talk too much after raising this issue. I summarise all my findings here:1. iPhone iOS has a bug in its Notes which can automatic remove locally stored data even you have upgrade to iOS16. Or maybe hardware storage is not stable (that may be dangerous to other data storage!)2. iPhone Notes locally stored data lost cannot be recovered by any methods.3. Apple cannot help at all and they don‚Äôt acknowledge this bug and they don‚Äôt want to take any responsibility to the data lost4. Please use iCould or your email accounts to store your Notes rather than local stored.

But as a designer I like Apple and I like the operating system so you end up staying with them.My most recent disaster was with my iPhone pro 11, I have just had the battery changed by Apple in Covent Garden and took it on holiday with me.While swimming I dropped it in the water but wasn't really bothered because it's waterproof and I have dropped it in water before.A day later the screen got a green line up it and was non operational to touch. I took it to the Apple Store in Covent Garden and explain the situation. They explained that it had indeed got water damage, but wasn't covered by any warranty and never was since it was only water resistant.The Italian government have already taken Apple to court over this matter and I know there is further court action happening in New York. But it's still shocking when you hear someone sat in front of you saying that your waterproof phone is only water resistant and only at 8m for 30mins. I said to the assistant that you find that statement contradictory. I also said it was clearly waterproof or water-resistant when you change the battery, to which she replied 'believe me Sir it would've been as good as the day it came out the factory if we replace the battery.' But they also said the glue they use to waterproof it weakens with time. That means 1 week I guess.Clearly this was not true since it had been in water before and never had a problem even though I had no idea that it was not waterproof but only water resistant and not covered ever by the warranty.To be honest when I bought it I don't remember it saying that it was only water resistant at eight meters for 30 seconds. But clearly Apple need to be more upfront about the water resistant claims since it contradicts the fact that they don't guarantee it and never did. It's a bit like me saying I'm a designer but I can't guarantee I can design. I assume the same is true of my Apple Watch which I swim with!!In the end the silence was too much and the Apple assistance mouth was just oddly gawping at me. It must be hard for these poor assistance to have to make excuses on behalf of their employer.So the bottom line is your phone is water resistant to x depth for X amount of time, plus it's also not advisable to take it into water because we don't guarantee it.It's really high time I left my dysfunctional relationship with Apple devices, hard as it is we can't go on.At the end of the day Apple probably have done some cost benefit analysis and decided the legal costs are worth factoring in.\", 'If I could give 0 stars I would !

There has been no innovation whatsoever since then other than making iPhones bigger (and 10X more expensive) and iPads smaller. Whoop-de-doo. Customer support used to be awesome as well. It simply is non-existent now. The Genius Bar also used to be a go-to place to get help with your Mac when all else failed. It is now absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to make an appt. Just try it. They have set up the website and even phone service so that you may not ever speak to a person or make an appt with the genius bar without actually going to the store first.

It was OK when I sent it so it may have been damaged in shipping or when I put it I the box which was very tight and hard to do. I alway buy Apple Care and prefer to pay it all at once. The 13 Pro Max, bought directly from Apple was on a monthly Apple Care payment agreement and they quit taking the money out for some unknown reason from my apple credit card. So now I have no Apple Care when I need it for the iPhone 13 Pro Max. I would return the 14 Pro Max and get one from AT&T but am afraid Apple will claim damage and not refund my money.

Aimed often lower than the realistic requirements, my advice is to avoid retail and business. They talk a great job, but the reality is not there. Don‚Äôt deal with this Company or Apple unless you have quality professional advice. Dig deep. Inquire, ask questions. Don‚Äôt be sucked in.

To be fair, I haven‚Äôt used Apple customer service in a couple of years and from what I remember it was always superb! However today it has been absolutely shocking and it is clear from looking at the other reviews here that Apple has gone downhill. This is very sad especially as they charge extortionate prices for their products. I‚Äôm trying to pre-order an apple iPhone 14 promax and have an Apple Store voucher, and two online vouchers. For some reason, you can‚Äôt use an Apple Store voucher online which I think is just ridiculous as all of the money goes to Apple anyway! This is archaic and I don‚Äôt know any other store that operates like this. I contacted their customer service today and have been talking to various people over the last three hours. None of the agents I  spoke to seem to know what they are doing. I had to repeat the issue multiple times to the same people. All of them giving me different responses.

It is under warranty. It spent a week with apple agents.  Agents have said it is not software, not battery and  unusual. Apple agree it is not right but all Apple do is insist they perform more tests. We are now 2 weeks on and they have run the same diagnostics over and over. Asked the same questions every call. Telling me there are more diagnostices to run. It passes all their tests, but discharges 10% each hour whislt sitting on a desk.I have to pay the ¬£42 costs for the initial inspection where they tell me something is wrong and it is unusual.Now I have to wait another week for them to take a look at the next set of tests. So three weeks of looking at my phone to see if they can replace it, never once suggesting it is working as it should. I am told there is yet another set of diagnosis at the end of the three weeks. Almost 10% of the phones life spent in apples remediation process..... no obvious outcome yet. So far over 4 hours on the phone, several hours more in the repair shop, a new phone costs Apple less than this if you charged out the time.So be warned, when you buy an i phone it should state clearly the battery life is expected to be under 8 hours within a year. Their telephone after sales service is non existant (lots of lovely people who cannot do anything). Their warranty is rendered inoperable for the burocracy.It all adds up to a major issue with the description of the goods under the sale of goods act in the UK.Escalated from tier one to tier two who tell me they have the authority to order a replacement. However they dont because the Engineers have the authority. Weird.We went to a Genius Bar ... they told us there ws nothing wrong, but we were very determined. The replacement phone lasts 5 to 6 times as long as the old one. Still Apple refuse to believe there was anything wrong with the old phone. In fact they were rude to very end suggesting I would be back within a week complaining about the new phone!! Their diagnostics are like the emissions tests on the VW cars, designed to show it is OK.

I sure could see my full charge on my credit card and that my gift cards were fully depleted too, as expected. Called a first agent who told me nothing to worry they still see my order processing and no issue. Called a second agent who could see something wrong with one of the gift cards not registering and they submitted a case with their payment team which could take up to 4 days to be resolved. Called a third agent who told me I didn\\'t pay enough so charged me another $35 or so on my card. Called a fourth time and got an agent a little more knowledgeable who saw the issue too, tried to fix it without success but at least initiated the refund to my credit card for the overcharge. However, they also needed to submit a case with their payment team there which could take a few days. Bet I won\\'t get my iPhone by Sep 16 but keeping my fingers crossed.

Every time there is an Apple update I have to do Apple‚Äòs job for them, find the new relevant bug, and sort it out myself because Apple are incapable of doing so, cause more issues with the new updates than they tend to alleviate.Why is it that customers are not told when there are updates and their phone stopped working with products from the App Store when, if only the customers could be told that their phones need updating, there would be no problem?You reach out to customer support at Apple, they give you bad information and you end up with an inferior product because they employ people who they do not train and who are ignorant costing us business customers in conscionable amounts of money.I‚Äôve now invested in an iPhone 11 Pro Max on the advice of Apple only to find that my provider is putting lots of new masts in my town with 5G and that my phone cannot receive it after asking Apple‚Äôs advice on what phone to buy.Is it any wonder that android shares are going up and Apple shares are going down?I‚Äôm tired of doing the job of Apple because I can‚Äôt maintain the system and I‚Äôm tired of talking to plonkers.‚ÄúFor sale ‚Äú. 24 Apple iPhones are various different models and, ‚Äúwanted ‚Äú24 new android phones which cost much less & will do 5G.Another multi level business customer lost through incompetent uncaring.', 'Apple were the exception to all.

I‚Äôm disappointed of the next iOS update, iOS 16. The biggest feature of this update is only changes in the lock screen, that‚Äòs it. Any other features are small and are not required for me. If I compare iOS 16 with Android 13, I honestly need to say that Android 13 is better than iOS 16. Android 13 has new design options like the Material You. It also has improvements in privacy and in the permission manager. iOS 16 is just about the lock screen, it doesn‚Äôt have any design changes or useful features at all.

I tried to call the store on June 10th to get an update, but I got a recording that they were busy and to leave a message.  The same thing happened on June 11th so I drove to the store that day.  It turns out that the Simply Mac store had gone out of business and June 9th and no one called me to notify me to pick up my computer.  The rental office of the mall could not open the shop for me to retrieve my computer because the Simply Mac had filed for bankruptcy and it was in litigation.

I will never buy apple product in my life. ‚ÄòTrust‚Äô was the only word in my mind every time a bought apple product.Apple can make nice products, but they can't seem to provide a fix for the device storage getting full issue.I hope for other's sake Apple (1) directly address the storage getting full issue to prevent it happening - e.g. lots of warnings at >95% full and at 97% full must delete stuff and cannot take more photos, (2) provide a proper fix for error 1110 and (3) provide a simple phone recovery environment to allow people to backup their data and/or delete unnecessary apps to free up spaceI lost 239 GB of data in principal pictures with my little daughter 7 years old, moment in my life and her spent in the last 2 years.

Now I am definitely switching. Seriously, I have never been treated so bad. Apple used to be the best company - what happened to you guys?? My iPhone 13 pro is 10 months old, still under Apple warranty yet the side button doesn‚Äôt work and has many other issues. Clearly hardware issue, clearly replacement needed. But no, they try to brush it off! They used to be so helpful, even the support online. Now it‚Äôs a bunch of useless people who don‚Äôt care.Also, I was 5‚Äô late for my appointment today at Regent St Apple Store BECAUSE of their own queue and they did not care and didn‚Äôt let me to my appointment although I was on time at the store!! Really disgusting and horrible customer care, I was with my infant and tried to reason with them so I can see a specialist today because the iPhone doesn‚Äôt lock - side button broken and they just said sorry wait for 2h although again it was THEIR fault. Apple- get back to 5-10 years ago when you treated your customer with respect! Lost meTo add: senior advisor called me, advised that I can get the faulty phone replace my at covent garden store, went there, spent another 2h and ¬£60 for taxi just to be told arrogantly by Anne-Marie (covent garden manager) they would not replace it and only Apple support can do that. Called Apple support again and they told me no the store deicides. They send you back and forth - and no one resolved or replaced the phone. No wonder you have the worst rating on Truspilot. Never again.', \"There was a hardware error with FACE ID that was their fault, and they fixed it, rightly so. 10 days later the phone wouldn't turn on, they said it was water damage, which means they didn't seal it correctly.

Instead, I ended up with a salesman named Matt.  He claimed he wasn\\'t a salesman, but the first words that popped out of his mouth after seeing my iPhone 6s was \"WOW! An antique!\"  Then he went into a spiel about how he doesn\\'t work on commission, but how it would only cost me $429.00 to upgrade to an iPhone SE. He tried to patronize me asking what I did for a living, etc.  Then another employee joined in and again remarked \"Oh! An antique!\", and proceeded to try to sell me the iPhone SE. The other employee reminded me that none of Apple\\'s employees work on commission but were only there to help me.  Then I met another employee who also reminded me that I had an old phone, and that the iPhone SE was much faster. He tried to patronize me complimenting me on my watch.  Finally, just to get the Hell out of there I agreed to buy the phone They\\'d really hammered me to buy the phone.  When I entered the store, I left my friend who\\'s suffering from dementia in the car.  I had no idea i would spend all that time when all I wanted was to unblock my apple account.  I finally told them I had to leave!  When I got to the parking garage my friend wasn\\'t in the car!  I wondered around until I finally found him way outside the garage.  Yesterday I returned the phone.  Today someone from Apple unlocked my Apple/ iTunes account.  I researched Apple\\'s sales training program; and they DO in fact encourage their employees to hammer the customers because (hopefully) the employee will get a promotion in the company.  The employees are a JOKE!   They\\'re caricatures of the old used car salesman wearing a checkerboard sport jacket and loud tie.  I liken them to mosquitoes on a muggy summer night!

On apple. com /nl the dutch apple website stayed today ordered, tomorrow at home. I thought I go for real quality, not a reseller like Coolblue, just direct at Apple, for the trust and that I can swap in my previous Iphone 11. Next day I got an email and I could follow the package, it was strange because my package with the Iphone 13 went from Eindhoven Netherlands to Brussel Belgium. And more strange that the package was on hold the next day. So I called Apple and they search it out and said, we dont know whats happen and we will do a research, this will take maximum 10 days. But I had no time to wait bcs of my holiday I should go. So I came with the solution, I go now by car 1 hour go and 1 hour return to Amsterdam Apple store and grab it there. No that was not possible, I can go to the Apple store but should paid that one too, and the other one I needed to wait till the research it was done and after that I shoul get money back. I went to the apple store and bought the 13, now I was just on time to go on holiday.In the meanwhile I got per post the paper cover to put my old Iphone in and send it to swap in. The employee from apple. com/ nl told me I should cancel my order and than I got automatically my money back, so I did do.When I was on holiday I received an email that the swap in should be canceled, if the Iphone 11 was already at the location it should be send back. I called again to say that they can keep and i want the money for the swap in 290 euro. No it goes by an external company, likewize. They couldnt call or email them because they have no phone number and not even an email program, are they lying or is this a strange community? Never met administration people without an emailadress..... So I should take contact and arrange everything by myself.After I came home from holiday the iphone 11 were sended back indeed. The good thing was I got the money back from the Iphone 13 i ordered. But now I had an Iphone 11 and I dont want to sell it at internet, that was the reason I did choose the swapp in/ trade in from apple. Now the woman told me that the apple store said things what was not true and appologize many times, I told her to search a solution and not think following the script, but I only hear her talking like a robot, and ask for a big discount than, the next time I buy I can get a small present, like a cable or Iphone cover.... they really dont listen, I asked to discus with her manager.... not possible. Online because I was 2 weeks later back from holiday my phone was now worth 270, 25 euro less, and they even dont want to pay for it. While the whole mistake is from apple. 25 euro is offcourse for them nothing. For me its a principe to, what a way how you treat your customers... The whole conversation was really bad, I feel like in a factory, like a number, not a client.They should do this: Sorry sir, ok here is a voucher for 25 euro, show me or prove that your iphone is less worth now and you get it. You can spend it on apple products. Than I said I want to complain about this customer service. She told me its only possible by sending a letter to apple in Ireland.... When you pay or when they need money or sell it all goes over internet, ones you complain send a letter to Ireland.... this is the way how they work... to build a wall and hope nobody will do. Why not: complaints at apple.com? They need to change their whole attitude! I got more angry and angry while the talk goes further. I didnt want to send a review. because I never do and dont want to waste my time. But at the moment Im still busy to sell my iphone 11 by the company Likewize what they send. Im afraid I need to go to the apple store again.....so much time wasting and loosed only because the **** customerservice from apple and all their internall rules, reallly not helpfull!!Think out of the box and with the client!

Joyce Gale', 'This is a testimony to how I was treated by Apple Support Portugal.Around 2018 I purchased a Macbook Pro 15 via Amazon and before the one year mark was up, I decided to purchase Apple Care + (3 extra years of support) just in case. When I received my invoice, though, I noticed the support date ended two years from the purchase date - not the 3 years I had been told via phone.This was when my ordeal began.I went to the support site and tried calling them, and after waiting for several minutes and the call not being picked up, it got disconnected. Strangely enough, when my intention was to make a purchase, customer support not only answered my calls immediately, but they even called me back within 5 minutes.I scheduled a support call (mind you, this was right after the purchase) and on my chosen date, I got no call.Fast forward a few months and numerous attempts to contact support again, and I still had no luck.One year later, after many failed calls and being blatantly ignored (scheduled calls, attempted calls from my part) I decided to contact US support. I got an immediate reply via chat, however, wrong country, so no one could answer why my Apple Care + was 2 years instead of 3. Great.On 2021, the 2 year extra support ends and lo and behold, my touchbar decides to stop working.After a few more attempts to contact or being contacted by Apple Portugal, I contact US support and a few troubleshooting steps later, the technician concludes with 100% certainty that my touchbar has to be replaced... Not only that, but since the replacement is out of warranty, it would cost me $1475 because the whole upper part of my latop had to be replaced - much like the keyboard replacement program.Again: my \"not 3 year\" Apple Care+ had just ended, like, 20 days prior to this. Murphy\\'s Law at its best...I ask if I can send it to be repaired under the keyboard replacement program, but no \"the device has to have proven keyboard issues to be repaired under that program\", which made me seriously consider shoving dirt under the keys just to cause an issue with the keyboard and have it repaired for free.At this point, I\\'m basically being punished for not having keyboard issues.However, once again, US service cannot help me any further because again: wrong country.I decide to live with a broken touchbar. It still worked, I just couldn\\'t see half of it and had to pretty much guess what I was pressing. I wasn\\'t going to invest 1500 bucks on a 2500 computer that I was still paying (loan).This was last month: I decided to reset the Macbook and upgrade it to Monterey and the touchbar issue resolved itself.Thank you Apple for the $1500 quote on a software issue.And thank you Apple Portugal for simply ignoring my existence (I have process numbers and proof of everything that happened).Anyway I hope my experience helps anyone who had/has issues with Apple, and particularly tech issues the touchbar on the A1990 2018 Macbook Pro and was told it would need to be repaired. Also it should serve as an eye-opener to Apple so they address the huge customer service problem here in Portugal.PS - I tried making a formal complaint in Apple forums and here\\'s their reply, after removing my post. Apparently censorship and silencing customers who have issues is considered good business practice:\"We removed your post Awful customer support in Portugal - Issue with touchbar because it contained rants or complaints that weren‚Äôt constructive. We understand wanting to share experiences, but these forums are meant for technical questions that can be answered by the community.\"I personally believe a non working touchbar that started working after an update qualifies as a tech problem... But it also means less money for Apple, right? So let\\'s pretend that it\\'s an hardware issue and charge people 1500 bucks for a replacement that doesn\\'t solve anything. And by the way, let\\'s not let anyone be made aware that it\\'s a software issue...Never again...', 'Defective Apple Watch: Apple blocks all new reviews on Apple.com and Google Maps!My family bought a 2017 Apple Watch, valued at $399‚Ä¶ and then proceeded to misplace it.

You\\'d think it would be an easy delivery, no? Well, you\\'d be wrong. We didn\\'t get it on Friday. Apple did collect the $923.56 from my wife on Saturday. But we didn\\'t get the phone on Saturday or Sunday either. On Monday July 25 I checked our order status at the Apple Store online. It said: \"Shipment on hold. There is an issue with your delivery and the carrier is unable to deliver your package. Please contact us at 1-800-MY-APPLE.\" Come again??? We live in downtown Chicago, about 1.4 miles from the Michigan Avenue Apple Store. We get deliveries from UPS all the time. There\\'s a doorman in our lobby twenty-four hours seven days a week. But UPS is unable to deliver our package? That\\'s very interesting. What happened? We\\'d love to know more.We checked the UPS website. They had updated their tracking information. It said they\\'d deliver the package by 7:00 PM that evening. We waited till past 7:00 PM. They didn\\'t. We called Apple. There was a nice lady who looked into it for us. She took a lot of notes. She said they had no idea what was going on. They would start an investigation. But we should call UPS, too. We called UPS. It took about twenty minutes before we managed to get past the automatic dragon lady who won\\'t let you talk to a human being unless you have a magic key. We spoke to a nice lady who looked into it for us. She said they couldn\\'t tell us anything. We weren\\'t the shipper. They can only talk to the shipper. We should ask Apple to start an investigation. We told her we already had. She said we should be patient. On Tuesday July 26 we called Apple again. We spoke to a nice man. He looked into it for us. He read all of the notes and took some more notes. He said he saw the problem. But he had no updates. We should be  patient. They have a process. It needs to run its course. We would hear from them no later than two days after they started the investigation. We didn\\'t. Today it\\'s Thursday July 28, a week since we placed the order, six days since it was shipped, five days since our money was collected. We still haven\\'t heard from Apple. But UPS did update their tracking information a while ago. It says that \"the delivery date will be provided as soon as possible.\" Apparently it wasn\\'t possible on Tuesday. It wasn\\'t possible on Wednesday either. Apparently it\\'s still not possible today. Can you believe it? We paid more than $900 for an Apple iPhone that was supposed to arrive six days ago. It must be somewhere in Chicago don\\'t you think? But where? When will we get it? Apple isn\\'t able to locate it?

I said I don‚Äôt know how the microphone was damaged but that had nothing to do with my display not working so could they just fix that??  Nope.

When I brought it in for service since it is a design flaw the costs were all politely played back to me anyway. Approximately 500 euro without a blink.

I have to drive one hour to go to the service store, but they can not diagnose it only if I leave this phone to them two days. I would not like to leave my phone cuz I will have no phone to use and I will have to drive back to get it, and the technician guy said they might only change the screen after open and check the phone.My iPhone is working well and brand new condition but with a small faulty black pixel on, I do not need more damage to the phone merely because it has a faulty pixel. So I called Apple service again to tell them the issue and ask for direct replacement because I did nothing wrong for this faulty product from them. They admit this faulty pixel might caused by the faulty hardware, or it might be caused by the software. Neither of the reasons was my fault, but according to their terms if I purchased an Apple product, I need to suffer all these troubles their faulty product caused. They will not replace it if I do not drive to the service store several time and let them open my iphone so them can find out what caused the faulty pixel even if I did not misuse.Apple causes so many troubles for customers to give up seeking for their right to get a good product in warranty time. I do not wanna to risk to get a broken phone after I got a faulty product.

You have to push them very hard. My dad said that it always was more difficult to write long letters but thought it was his fault. Now that the problem got worse we went to an official apple service store, lab9. They referred to the service program and said it was a free repair. The laptop went in for diagnosis. After a few days he got a call from the store. The program is valid for 4 years after purchasing. Now he has to pay 700EUR.There is also a problem with the screen. It show vertical flikkering lines. Those lines are only visible on grey or light blue parts on the screen. For this problem he has to pay 800EUR. The repair costs are totally crazy.We called Apple Support. They said the program expired and they would not help us in any other way. Even after a call with a senior they refused to help.My dad paid a lot of money for a good quality product. He expected to do 6 or 8 years with his machine. Instead he got a faulty product that was never working good. The arrogance of Apple Support was shocking. We are deeply disappointed in the quality and service from Apple.The butterfly keyboard problem is a hidden default on the date of purchase. The new laptops have a better keyboard since 2019. So Apple knows it was a bad mechanism.I gave my dad my backup MacBook Pro 15\" 2013. The reason I told him he should buy an Apple Macbook. It still works perfect.After a few google searches we are not alone with this problem.What can we do now?To Apple: people will not forget.

The insanity enters at this point. In order to reset these security questions, they asked me to answer one of them again!! I still couldn't answer so that was that. Catch 22.

The issue is that all the configurations, progress and additions made to these apps will be gone. It's fu***** madness! Every other account I have updated where this kind of issue arose was fixable because the company concerned sent an email with a link in it that I could use to reset the login/password/security question/whatever.

It's with UPS and the date for delivery has changed once again. First showing the 28 April and now 11-18 May. Apple are of no help at all. I have lost clients and work because of this.

This is 2 months delay on top of the 1.5 month of initial wait!What is really upsetting is that Apple surely knew long before that they cannot deliver this week. However, they chose to inform me today, just in the week that the Macbook was due to be delivered, leaving me with an emergency tech situation to sort out for myself.

So you cant put any truthful negative reviews about an app you are using on THEIR platform. Ive hated Apple my entire 40 years and I will die hating them. Do not use. Ban Apple.

I have been using various Android devices and never had this issue with any of the other manufacturers.\", 'I ordered a very expensive new MacBook Pro, back on 4th March. The delivery timetable was clear on the Apple Store site -- I would have to wait longer because I was ordering the computer with the larger screen. Apart from choosing the model w/a 16\" screen, everything else about my order was standard.Nevertheless, Apple has apparently chosen not to stock these machines in its stores -- instead, the company with a larger market capitalisation than ANY OTHER COMPANY ON THE PLANET has opted for the \\'just-in-time\\' supply chain strategy favoured by most other large multinationals.That\\'s all fine, so long as customer needs and expectations are managed proactively by Apple. But here, they have failed completely -- I was told at the time I placed my order that I should expect to wait roughly 8 weeks for delivery. This was irritating and put pressure on me to keep my ailing, 7-year-old MacBook Pro operational, but I was informed of the timetable for delivery BEFORE I placed my order, so at least I could make an informed decision.Now, however, Apple is apparently having supply chain problems. Two weeks ago, they confirmed I could expect delivery this week (w/c 25th April); today, I received an update announcing the new deliery window is now between 14-27th JUNE).The unfortunate customer service reps I spoke with after receiving this unwelcome news had nothing useful to tell me, other than the usual scripted acknowledgements of my frustration and apologies for inconvenience.Sorry, Apple -- THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.Perhaps consider dedicating a tiny fraction of your insane market cap to establishing a more diversified supply chain, given there\\'s no end in sight to the factors we can all presume will continue to disrupt manufacturing for the foreseeable future.I look forward to the day when another disruptor comes along and finally deposes Apple as the only useful non-Windows/Android option.', 'Apple is fighting against cryptocurrency progress and is thereby supporting the fiat currency fraud scams which are popular today.

They don't seem to care too much for customers. Customer relations consultant explained that under consumer law they will not repair it for free as it's above 2y from delivery date. Which is in conflict with their own page public info that consumer law cover period in UK is 6 years.If you don't wont to risk extra costs then look for other phone or sell it when it's still in warranty period.

The App Review Team and App Review Board have been consistently rejecting my app, the reason being:\"Guideline 4.3 - Design We continue to find that your app provides the same feature set as other apps submitted to the App Store; it simply varies in content or language, which is considered a form of spam.\"This is 100% false because my app has unique features not found on other apps on the App Store. My app does comply with the App Store Review Guidelines because it offers unique, high quality features not found on other apps.Based on their definition of 4.3.0, their claim of my app violating 4.3.0 is false and not valid.The strange part is that the supposedly similar apps don\\'t offer the features that my app offers, yet those apps are able to get their app submissions approved (April 2022).I should also mention that those apps were published after mine. I have already notified them about this. I have provided screenshots, video demos, source code, spoken to the App Review team and the App Review Board, filed numerous appeals and they are still rejecting the app because of 4.3.0.They appear to be ignoring the information I\\'ve been providing and are responding to me with generic responses.At this time, as I have exhausted all options, I\\'ve filed a complaint with the BBB and have consulted a lawyer to look at this case.

One time, they told me that my Macbook had water damage so they could not retrieve my data for me since it was ‚Äúall rusted‚Äù. This was BS because my friend was able to recover everything for me weeks later. I‚Äôve had other poor customer service experiences with them, but let‚Äôs talk about the one from today.Apple had a recall / product defect with their Macbook pro where the keyboard double types letters. I was not even notified about this that I know of, and if I was there was definitely no ‚Äòdeadline‚Äô mentioned. I only found out through my friend. In the past year, I visited apple store multiple times to get this addressed, making appointments. Once, I even started a conversation online and she helped me make the Genius Bar appointment. Each time, the Genius Bar was delayed to the point that I waited 30+ minutes at the Genius bar and then had to go home or back to work. None of these visits were logged by Apple. Maybe because I never got to talk to a ‚Äúgenius‚Äù since they were all busy. Today, I went to the Apple store, finally made it to the Genius specialist, and they said they can‚Äôt fix my keyboard because the 4 year warranty passed 2 months ago. They saw no logs of me coming to the apple store to fix this, and said I have to contact support over the phone since they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have the power to make an exception‚Äù. Phone specialist says they have to back up the store specialists, and that they have no record of me trying to fix this before Feb 25. Phone specialist also said the in store specialist DO have the power to make exceptions, and that the log shows ‚Äúexception denied‚Äù. So they managed to log this, but not the numerous times I talked to Apple? And they lied about not ‚Äúhaving the authority to make this decision‚Äù lol.Are you kidding me?

But I can't turn off the fingerprint lock garbage. I try adding her as a family member sharing. It makes her go get an apple id using a credit card and everything just to not let her join because the process is so convoluted that it literally brakes.

So we both just wasted 30 minutes, my wife had to get an apple id and jump through all these hoops just to not have their stupid family sharing garbage work. Why lock a device I purchased.

Come posso risolvere? qualcuno pu√≤ aiutarmi?I have problems with the keyboard of my macbook pro from 15 \"of 2018 the pc is out of warranty but there is the apple recall campaign for the keyboards of that year, I contact the specialist support and we agree on the replacement on 03/19 / 22, the mac is shipped and comes back on 03/24, I try it and I realize that the problem of sticky keys is present on the new topcase. I contact the specialist support again and in the morning of 03/25 I send the package back to apple support. It arrives at apple this morning and after a couple of hours that the technicians were inspecting my macbook I see an email arriving in which I am blamed for accidental damage on the keyboard (I did not use the macbook pro when it returned from the first assistance). Obviously before sending the package I always take demonstration photos to certify the integrity of the product and, to date, nobody wants to see my photos. I will have contacted the specialist support more than 10 times to solve the problem but to no avail, they have to do their own checks. I who have clear evidence of the problem in question are left without a pc, while they do their checks without any expiration date.

However they don\\'t actually have a phone in the store and I should come back in 2-3 days to get and pay for my replacement.So effectively they\\'re telling me: Sorry, but please get lost with a phone that we completely broke and live without a phone for 2-3 days. Obviously this is a problem / impossible in today\\'s world for both work and personal life!So I ask for a replacement phone for the 2-3 days: Nope.I ask whether the other Apple Store in the city (far away) could help me: They cannot say and won\\'t even tell me whether they have a phone in store, but expect me to just go and hope. They refuse to call and ask them, because it\\'s not the policy.I ask to speak to the store manager: They send someone who tries to pretend to be the store manager, who tells me to just accept it.I ask for the real store manager: A women called Ulrike (she refuses to tell me her last name) comes and claims to be the real store manager. I explain the situation and she just says there is nothing she can do (including not connected me with someone higher up, who could solve the problem).At this point I\\'m actually just very confused and sad. I cannot believe that this is the way Apple treats a customer that has spent ‚Ç¨10k+ on Apple products privately during his life, not even counting using and evangelising their products at work. I actually love Apple products from both a design and product perspective and I also work in tech so I know, or at least hope, that HQ Apple would hate to see their customers be treated this way.I\\'m honestly just so confused, sad, and disappointed. I still cannot believe what just happened, I\\'m an business owner myself and I (and I hope every other business owner) would never-ever-ever treat customers this way. The most ironic part: I\\'m writing this from my (Apple!) MacBook Pro, since my phone doesn\\'t work...Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading. Hope this helps potential future Apple customers know where they stand when they have a problem that doesn\\'t fall into the Apple standard processes. I\\'m just sad that the most valuable company in the world treats its\\' customers this way.

However, I bought Airpod Pros, and these are by far the worst Apple product I have ever used. I took them back to the shop now 4 times, and spent hours on the phone with their tech support. They replaced first one airpod, the the second, then the case, then did firmware updates and still they drop calls, switch between devices when not meant to, and Apple does nothing to truly fix the problem.  I bought the AirPods at an airport shop after my original AirPods stopped holding a charge (they were old, and no complaints, those had worked well for several years). Apple uses this excuse to not stand 100% behind their product. Very poor. When Apple does this, they lose the reason people are willing to pay a premium. And I highly recommend not wasting you money and time on Airpod Pros.', 'No interest in the customer sell you a watch without a charger adapter and then when you call them tell you it‚Äôs not included in the sale and it‚Äôs extra cost.

People were telling me before that they sell products with just the right amount of defects or low-quality parts so they stop working 3 years after they are been bought, but this time this expensive piece of garbage didn't even reach 2 years and a half. Before it shut down forever, it would discharge in about 40 minutes of usage, which completely defeats the purpose of having a mobile device. I had to walk around the office with a changer and prey I found an outlet that's not taken by other Apple users. Same with my last iPhone. What is the purpose of having a mobile phone if it won't last you at least while you are at the office???In 2020 I decided that I am not going to give them another chance of ripping me off and I bought a Samsung tablet and phone. I can finally use my mobile devices away from the outlet. I wonder when people are going to figure out that this company is dead. It makes me think of the frog example. You put a frog in a pot filled with boiling water, it's going to jump out immediately, but if you put the frog in cold water and you start to heat it up progressively, it would die there boiling.

I financed an Apple 13 pro and I got Apple Care+ with Theft and Loss which should cover your phone if it is lost. While traveling we were put to sleep and robbed at our Airbnb and our phones were stolen. When I tried to log in to my account, my phone was put into something that Apple calls \"Recovery Mode\" and they cut my access from my account for 18 days because people who stole it, tried to get into the phone and for security reasons, Apple put my account on such a long non-sense hold. After the 18 days was over, I logged into my account and my device was not showing under my account. Of course the thieves were not sitting around for me to log in and find their location. They either jalbroke my phone, or they took it into pieces and used the hardware. Here is Apple\\'s loophole. In order to file a lost phone claim, I have to log into my account and put the phone in \"Lost Mode\" but this is not an option because for no reason my phone had disappeared and does not show on my account. How is that under my control? They are saying that I might have turn the \"Find My Phone\" option off which I never did. The funny fact is that when you turn that off, Apple sends you an email that the option was turned off. I never received that email and Apple knows that because they keep the record of everything in their system. In the end, Apple is telling me to go F*** myself because of their loophole I cant file a claim and the $1200 phone is gone. What is the point of getting insurance? I am switching from Apple after more than 10 years because their customer service and their ethics of business are disgusting. Apple gave 18 days to the thieves to do whatever they want so I have to go back and buy another phone from them. So unfair, so wrong. The fact is that I have insurance and my phone is stolen from me and the insurance has to cover it. Now the way to file is defined by Apple in a way for them to benefit from this.

The questionnaire has limited number of questions and I was unable to indicate the camera screen was cracked which I wanted to do.

A nasty, self-centred and rapacious company that puts profit before anything else especially the customer or the environment.

That is my last Apple product ever. I will tell everyone I meet of this story and put others off from buying your products. However ever small an impact that may amount to.

Matters that seem to be relatively simple and straight forward when dealing with any other business, from a startup small business on up to a Fortune 500 company, are apparently very difficult or impossible for Apple to accomplish.It appears that Apple is not familiar with elements of modern technology, specifically in regards to how to give and receive phone calls or communications over the internet.Of all of the companies I have dealt with for the past decade or so, the company which has shown itself to be the most technically challenged and behind-the-times in the fields of internet technology and telecommunications, is Apple, Inc.Specifically:1. I signed up online for an Apple developer account, which was the first step to getting a payment processing account.2. I then received an email stating that the application could not be completed without a phone call.  This is a dated technology (phone communications). Such dated technology is not usually needed by modern corporations familiar with 21st internet technologies used for long distance communications.  Even in the case where a face-to-face meeting is desired for verification purposes, we have numerous methods of accomplishing this which are far more advanced than telephones.3. Nevertheless, I set aside a time to call Apple, despite recognizing that this company is behind the times.4. When I attempted to contact Apple, I found that they had other issues.  There is no phone number to call.  The only way to contact them is to go online and submit a request for them to contact me.5. Despite this outdated technology and hassle, I input my phone number and waited for their call.6. I attempted this numerous times. On some occasions, my phone rang but when I answered and responded, I heard only silence.  On other occasions, the phone did not ring at all and I then received an email that Apple was \"trying to reach me.\"  7. I contacted Apple by email and requested to have their phone number so that I could call them, since they were not able to call me.8. Apple support then told me that they do not have a phone number to receive calls.  (Another indicator that this company is about 100 years behind modern times: they are demanding a phone call, but have no number.)9. I again made an appointment for Apple to call me.10. I arranged my schedule and made myself available for the call.  Again, the same pattern repeated. On some occasions, the phone rang, I picked up and answered, and heard silence.

I've just received a call from JLP to tell me that an Apple engineer has inspected the Macbook and found a 'pressure crack' in the screen causing an LCD bleed and this is not covered by their guarantee.

In short it's been a waste of time and money and extremely frustrating. I don't understand how a technical product such as an Iphone which was working absolutely fine can suddenly stop connecting to wifi, rendering it useless.

No scans at all & that we should immediately make Apple aware that they needed to immediately begin an investigation! Called Apple and spoke to several advisers & a manager & none of them would have it at all insiting they had tracking info that stated it was DEFINITELY going to be delivered to me on the 26th July (which DHL Express were shocked to hear as their systems were more detailed & they couldn't find that information) I argued & argued & argued and they insisted it would arrive with me today!

I had it repaired by an authorized Apple repair center because the laptop was covered under warranty. The Apple store rep did mention the repair may erase my data (not all of it was backed up); however, they never mentioned that I would not get any of my old parts back! Also, the laptop was returned in under a week which leads me to believe they never even attempted to retrieve my data from the hard drive or may have no way to do it. I wouldn\\'t know because none of those details were mentioned on the product repair summary slip returned with my laptop! This is a problem because the hard drive (which stores sensitive data) is now welded to the logic boards on the new Apple laptops (the old Apple laptops internally stored them separately). I did not learn this until recently that the hard drive is attached to the logic board on the new laptops and all housed together. But why would they keep the old part(s) and not send it back to me, the customer and rightful owner of the part, nor tell me why? Perhaps if I had received my old part(s) back then I could have retrieved my data! Since several parts are \"all in one\" now, how do I know what was broke and what was ok?? They certainly never provided me those details. Not to mention, what did the \"authorized Apple repair center\" do with my old logic board/hard drive?? That hard drive contained sensitive financial and personal data on it, so why not tell the customer what happens to their old parts, especially parts that house sensitive data?? I did contact Apple support and they basically said once you sign off to have the repair done, they get to keep your old part(s) and erase your data and never give any details as to what really happened or what went wrong!

I just used it to help myself in my job, she kept repeating talk to your job administrator, then I informed her that I was an apple care customer and requested that she schedule an appointment for me. She asked for my  serial number then said she didn't recognize it as an apple product and that she could not help me anymore. I said my problem is with iCloud and gave her my Mac serial number , then she said we chatted about an iPad , so she couldn't help. this conversation had gone on very long with her not reading or understanding my problem, and sending more links that had nothing to do with my issue. I told her I would report her and she sent a link for feedback about apple products not service. I hung up on her and scheduled a call back myself on the site which I had asked her to do.

I said I hope now you are working with apple and that you will try to help me. But she sent another link showing hoe to reset my password.

Essentially, they are now holding my existing phone to ransom despite having already agreed that they should be replacing it under warranty terms.  They refuse to return it to me.  They messed up and thought I had signed an 'exchange' document, but they know they never showed me such a document, much less asked me to sign it, and still they won't admit that they therefore should return my old phone to me along with the new one they agreed to give me.

There was a time I was ready to get a tattoo of the logo on my heart to show my devotion. I used to sell them to people as an Apple seller with 150% belief that it was the BEST computer on earth. Today not so much. I bought a brand new iMac retina 27\" desk top from Apple.ca with upgrades which cost me 8K when said and done. It took over 2 weeks to get delivered (from china!) But I thought worth the wait. Once here I unboxed it, turned it on to install my basic needs, email plus Adobe  creative cloud.

Spoke to individual who made me do a bunch of useless plug in and unplugging steps over and over even though I repeatedly told them it does not turn on. I finally was connected to the nearest Apple store near me which is a ferry ride away as I live remotely. First thing the person says is can you tell me what the issue is with your iPhone??!! After explaining that I have been on the phone for over an hour discussing my iMac not my ijunk, they tell me because I bought it on line the Apple store will not be able to do the return!

On Thursday July 8, 2021 I was working outside most of the day with both phones in my pocket. Raleigh, NC was experiencing heavy rains due to a tropical storm. On Friday night, 7/9/21, the display on the iPhone 12 went out. Went online and made an appointment at an Apple store for 7/10/21. The agent determined that it was water damage and offered the following solutions: 1) pay $449 for a repair/replacement. 2) buy a new phone starting at $399 and up based on various models. 3) pay $449 for a replacement iPhone 12 and then add 2 year warranty for $199 with a $99 deductible. However, even though I would be getting a new iPhone 12, the warranty would be retroactive to the original date of October 2020. If I spent $449 for a new iPhone and compared extended warranty to no extended warranty it would be like this if I had another incident with water damage:Warranty: 15 months coverage (now thru Oct 2022) $199 + $99 deductible = $298No warranty: $449 for replacement iPhone My argument was that the iPhone 12 has a higher water resistance rating than does the iPhone 8. In addition, the water resistance decreases over time. The iPhone 8 is several years old and the iPhone 12 is less than a year old. Yet, both phones were exposed to the rain storm while in my pocket. The iPhone 8 is still working and the iPhone 12 is not. The Apple agent stated that Apple does not get into the reasons or circumstances of how the water damage occurred, only that there is water damage and therefore it is not covered under their warranty. My counter that it appears that there was a manufacturing defect since the higher rated iPhone 12 was not as water resistant as the much older iPhone 8 was met with Apple policy of water damage = no warranty and no chance of manufacturing defect ever.', \"My macbook pro 2014  is loud when I open single tab or PS.

WARRANTY: My device in warranty, and they are wasting time because the warranty is going to expire soon. VIDEO PROOF: I HAVE A VIDEO PROOF WHERE I RECORDED ISSUES IN THE SERVICE CENTER, HOME, OUTSIDE AS WELL. IMAGE PROOF: UPLOADED, WHERE THEY MARKED DEVICE AS FIXED/DELIVERED BUT AFTER THAT ISSUE SHOWING ON SCREEN. SOLUTION: my all work is based on iPhone and MacBook because I am an application developer. So Please replace this device as I can't visit the service center again and again.\", \"Bought a iPod touch for daughter's birthday with applecare+ protection.  Within a couple of weeks she dropped it from a low height (60-80cm above the floor) and despite being in an expensive apple protection case it developed a hairline crack.  I called up and arranged the return under Applecare+, the box was received and it was sent off to apple for repair.  So far, so normal...A couple of days later I received an email back saying that it was being sent back to me unrepaired and that it was not eligible for applecare+ repair.  I called up and no one at apple really seemed to know what was going on as it's a different company that deals with repairs.  I was told that the iPod might have have been deemed beyond economic repair.  The next day the iPod arrived back to me, with the same hairline crack to the screen.  I called up apple again and asked why it had not been repaired under applecare+ - again, total confusion, much waiting on the line and generally no real idea.  All that happened was I was told a new box would be sent and I would have to go through the same process once again, this time with a contact at apple I could call if the same nonsense happened again.Ridiculous waste of time.  Once upon a time you would accept apple's premium prices because of the quality of the service and aftercare.  This does not appear to be the case.  I would estimate I've spent about 3-4 hours trying to resolve what should have been a straightforward repair thus far thanks to failure in apple''s processes & systems.  Not acceptable.  At no point did anyone at apple offer a goodwill gesture / compensation for the hassle and the time I've had to waste on this matter.I had been considering upgrading my MBP to a M2 chip MBP later in 2021 when they are released.  On the basis of my experience dealing with apple support I will be reconsidering that decision.EDITHaving been given cast-iron assurances that the first return of the item without being repaired under applecare+ was a mistake I have just received notification that they are sending back the iPod again to me, once again unprepared.  I have *literally* spent 4 hours on calls to apple support who just seem as bewildered as me as to what's going on.  I'm currently 35 minutes into a call I'm being asked once again to prove that the iPod was working and only had a hairline crack...  They've received the device twice now.TOTAL. UTTER. SHAMBLES.

Apple is clearly enjoying a position of monopoly by keeping pushing nice looking hardware on a thirsty market, neglecting the long-term consequences of a bad customer care.Now, to the point in case: my Macbook Pro is not even 3.5yrs old and became unusable because of well-known and in internet forums documented hardware defects. I start experiencing problems already a couple of years ago, with the built-in camera out of order. I could still survive without it, as the warranty expired already, although I felt a laptop of this price range should have a longer longevity of the camera. Then the problem with repeated keys on the keyboard appeared. I am a programmer, so you can imagine how this is hitting on my nerves (and professional efficiency in the end) when with the time this becomes a frequent failure. The last drop came few weeks ago, when the so-called ‚Äúflexgate‚Äù issue started affecting my laptop as well. Display goes off as soon as the lid is opens over a certain tilting angle (about 40¬∞, below that angle I really challenge everyone to use it for a normal job). Obviously, I could not keep using it and I brought it to the next service point. Although the defect is identical to the one recognized as covered under the Service-Program on the 13‚Äù model, the authorized service point rejected to cover all 3 defects, presenting a huge estimate for the repair.The first frustration came, as the Apple phone support suggested me to go to the next service point on the wrong opening times. I had to drive there twice during the same day. Secondly, they did not speak about costs which might have been incurred even in case the parts were not replaced. As I said, I was in a different country and apart from the language barrier, I was assuming, diagnosing a fault was not charged to the customer, as it happens in the country where I bought the item. Instead, 2 weeks after the service point presented me an invoice through email, no repair done, no goodwill exceptions approved. Not even a phone call is an Apple customer worth.The service point was hiding behind the fact that they had to check with Apple, if the defects were to be covered or not under any service program and could not know in advance about the decision.Now, obviously I was not happy with that outcome and called the Apple support again. The personnel are not showing any empathy to the customer, regardless whether I bought merely an iPhone plastic cover or if I had been a loyal customer of expensive hardware during several years in the past. They keep repeating that if any goodwill exception, this must be coming from the local service-point, which as you can imagine, in turn bounces back the responsibility onto the manufacturer. At the same time, Apple does not do anything to push the service point in doing so. What a disaster of a worldwide enterprise who should really take seriously the advice or changing things for the better! The impression is really, that Apple claims to operate on the field through a well-established network of authorized resellers and service points, but in fact they are totally disconnected and not working together, at least when it comes to meet the customer‚Äôs needs.I have been working in a customer support role for a high-end product for 15 years and the first thing you learn, is that customer is king, especially, when he has invested a consistent amount of money into the brand and when an evident failure is not caused by customer abuse but rather linked to a product demonstrated weakness. Apparently Apple is not yet realizing that basic rule or is showing arrogance enough vs. customer retention and advocacy based on the high profit they are earning through pure marketing investments.', 'What a terrible customers and policy! They will be lost their customers and money if they don‚Äôt change their policy right. In a way to say their policy isn‚Äôt making any sense at all.

I don‚Äôt know..... they had charged me on some suspicious purchases that I didn‚Äôt agree nor consent to, even though I requested a refund or cancellation. They still keep charging you in the next cycle of payment. Of course people will commonly call to their bank and dispute the charge. What‚Äôs the matter with that right?! But however they suspended my payment method like forever and they gave me an excuse that I should reach them out before I call to the bank. Like seriously???!!

The Apple Store wanted over $1000 and tried to get us to buy the latest model, so we said no. We took it to a local repair shop who did the job in under $300 but they needed to replace the button (this was a long time ago) on the bottom of the screen. He replaced the button but then the phone stopped working. He then discovered that Apple designed the phone to \"resist\" non-Apple store repairs on the devices. So the phone stopped working, we took it to the Apple Store and they refused to unlock it for us because they said we have an unauthorized repair done on the device and you guessed it... they tried to sell us a new one.Never again.

I also purchased 15 individual cartoons from the Bugs Bunny 80th Anniversary Collection.  The entire collection sells for $39.99, or you can purchase them individually for $2.99 each.  Many of these cartoons were repeats of ones that I had already purchased from previous sets, which is why I didn‚Äôt buy the complete set of this item to begin with.  Each time I bought an individual cartoon the price to complete the entire set went down by the amount I paid for the individual cartoon, in this case $2.99.  So after buying the first individual cartoon I could complete the set by paying $37, and after the second cartoon by paying $34.01 etc.   I ended up purchasing 15 individual cartoons for a total of $44.85, which is more than the cost of buying the whole set.  At that point I assumed the cost to complete the set would be 0, since I had paid more than the original $39.99 price for the entire set.  To my surprise that wasn‚Äôt the case.  The price to complete the set reverted back to $39.99.  I contacted Apple multiple times regarding this, twice by chat and twice by phone.  I explained to them what happened.  They have a record to verify what I told them.  I respectfully asked if the could complete my set since I had paid more than the asking price, or if they couldn‚Äôt do that then could they please refund the money I paid for the individual cartoons and then I would purchase the entire set for $39.99.  Both of my requests were refused.  I even had two supervisors get involved, the last one by the name of Janina.  It didn‚Äôt help.  This is not a lot of money.  That isn‚Äôt the point.  What is disappointing is that I no longer feel I can trust Apple.  To treat a long-standing previously loyal customer in this way, by refusing a simple reasonable request, tells me everything I need to know about this company and it‚Äôs culture.  It‚Äôs sad really, because when I first started buying Apple products I raved to my friends about how great their customer service was.  At that time it was the gold standard in my opinion.  Those days are over.  This is the worst customer service I‚Äôve experienced from any company.', \"We have had Apple products for years, we still have the 1st computers that came out.

It's been happening for 13 years and Apple knows about it.The only way to get your money back is to prove to Apple that your balance wasn't $0.00 before the iOs update. This requires hours waiting on hold, escalating to senior CSR's and having the proof, for instance- the physical gift cards you redemmed. A process that can take hours or days.Some users that have the time and energy to bear that process are able to get their balance restored, but what about everyone else?Apple simply absorbs the profit.Even worse, if you mention disappearing account balances on the Apple forums, your questions get deleted and you get blocked from posting entirely.I'll be migrating back to Android as my phones and tablets get replaced.\", 'I bought a new iPad Air, and after answering all the questions, I was told that I would get $280 for trading in  my old iPad.

It feels like it literally offers the best possible sound quality on the market. it has noice cancellation, so it can create the perfect opportunity for you to clean the house and vacuum and have the washer machines on while you are listening to your favorite podcast. I use it this way. I don't try to use it outside a lot, because it actually cancels out a lot of noises, which can easily create some sorts of dangerous situations if you are not very careful or attentive to what's going on outside, watching out for cars etc. Just better use it in safe situations.\", \"Apple always delivers quality. Sure, their products are rarely the most innovative on the market, but Apple has, in my personal opinion, the most polished products on the market. After you have paid for the products, they work flawlessly for many years to come. For example, look at iOS where Apple offers 5-6 years of major iOS updates, and a total of 7-8 years of security updates (in some cases even 9-10 years). Apple is the best when it comes to the long life cycles of their products, and that's what you pay for. In this dark and unstable world with many problems, you can always trust that Apple is there for you and delivers quality, unlike everyone else on this planet.\", 'My autistic son received his new iPhone 15 today.

She could hear how upset my son was and went beyond anything Iv ever experienced to help the situation and sort it out. Once she sorted the transfer out she went on his phone to make sure all settings were correct and make sure everything was as it should be.

Am using Apple since 2004 and the only issue that I have faced is of late when they are trying to hijack freedom from a lot of things in their platform like mandatory use of some of their apps on mac and iPhone as well as Apple TV.

For other devices than the iPhone they work just the same degradation-wise, they are all pricey yet effective.

The Airpods (1st generation) released in 2016, Airpods (2nd generation) released in 2019, Airpods Pro released in 2019 and Airpods Max released in 2020. Mostly all of these are approximately priced more than 150$ and can be up to 549$ with the latest series. From my perspective, I didn‚Äôt use other airpods here the reasons why.Firstly, the airpods 1 have no active noise cancellation, which means outside noise may interfere with user listening experiences. Short battery life around 5 hours of listening time and 2 hours of talking time for 1 single charge, this may not be enough for some users. Airpods 1 might work well with Apple devices, they may not work well with other brand devices, and some features might be limited or not available at all. Additionally, some users have reported that there are connection issues with older system devices. Secondly, the airpods 2 lack water resistance, which means they can be damaged internally by water splashes, sweat and rain. Airpods 2 don‚Äôt have active noise cancellation. Also short battery life around 5 hours if listening time and 3 hours of talking time on single charge.Lastly, The AirPods Max are one of the most expensive headphones on the overall headphone market. It is very bulky and heavy to carry around. The Airpods Max are heavier and bulkier than other popular headphones, which make the users feel uncomfortable wearing them for many hours. There is no power-off button on Airpods Max, which means they are always in a low-power battery mode, even when they are not in use. This makes the battery life feel shorter for some users. Lastly, airpods max do not support lossless audio, which means you may not be able to enjoy highest quality audio files. I have been using airpods pro for approximately 3 years now. The reasons why I bought airpods pro are active noise cancellation, comfortable carrying around and better compatibility with ios and other devices. The ios make the airpods pro easy to connect to other apple devices. The battery life is acceptable, the battery of the airpods pro lasts about 4.5 hours with active noise cancellation turned on. It can also connect and be compatible with other devices with bluetooth.However, there are some flaws. After using it for many years, the microphone doesn‚Äôt work for me anymore. When I use it for phone calls I need to change to the original microphone instead of using the airpods microphone. The earbuds are also damaged and worn out making the sound not contained in the ear also making the noise cancellation  doesn‚Äôt work. Later, when I figured out that I needed to buy new earbuds, I found out that Apple only gives me 1 pair of each earbud size (small, medium, and large). I decided to buy new earbuds from another brand because apple earbuds are really expensive.As a result, I think that Apple Airpods pro is the best series compared to the other series. It might not be affordable for everyone, however I think it is totally worth it if you want to buy new wireless headphones.', 'Apple devices are solid and great in terms of security', 'Apple has a strong reputation for quality and innovation, and continues to be a leader in the technology industry.', 'love my new iphone, these guys know how to make a phone', 'thanks for the the iphone, I cannot ask better device than this', 'Not sure why all the bad reviews, I switched over to apple a few years ago and loved it every since', '5 stars for professionalism, but maybe 2 stars for knowledge?After purchasing a new Mac I called apple support to help set up my airdrop.  I was told  to connect the bluetooth, but after a lot of work the devises never would support a connection.  After a screen share session and much effort  I was told the computer was probably not working.  So I returned it and purchased an upgrade iMac.  The same thing happened though.  I then called tech support 3 different times to see if they can help me connect my newer iMac bluetooth to my iPhone.  After sensing a bit of  confusion l I was wondering why tech support seemed quite uninformed about this issue. Not one of the 4 calls resulted in clarity that bluetooth is not supported or necessary. For such info I was able to discover within my own research that these devise do not connect via bluetooth.  The airdrop is automatically supported between devices.  It took a lot of back and for with Apple, and a big hassle it was to say the least.  I just wonder why tech support did not know this basic info.  I realize the information is easily discoverable via a Google search.  I probably will no longer rely on Apple tech support any more after this experience.', 'Never had any issues with apple and great customer service always.', 'Customer service at my town is friendly! They helped me a lot tyyyy', 'Date of experience: September 15, 2023', \"Having been a customer of Apple for many years, I could simply never go back to using Windows/Android again. Apple is just so much easier - from the purchase experience to everyday usage, to support and find suitable replacements when necessary. Customer service over the phone is honestly the best I've probably received from any company and the in-store experience reflects this, staff are always very attentive and go above and beyond to answer your question or find you the best product. iCloud is an amazing service and really simplifies cloud storage, Apple Music is very simple and the quality of the music sound itself is great, Apple TV+ has a limited selection of shows although what is on offer is of outstanding quality and is far better than Netflix/Disney+/Amazon and Arcade is also packed full of free great games which are all ad-free. Apple really know what a good purchase experience is like, bought many products over the years from their stores and the staff are dedicated to answering any questions you have, and from what I've experienced, tell you the truth and don't oversell your products you don't need. For example, I was advised by a staff member to go for an iPhone 14 Plus instead of the iPhone 14 Pro Max as I didn't require the extra features, which now I totally agree with and saved me hundreds of pounds. Macs are of really great quality and so much easier to use than Windows, little things you take for granted which aren't available on Windows or are much harder to use. HomePod Mini packs a punch and is an incredibly good value at only ¬£89, far better than Alexa and I'd even compare them to Sonos at double the price. Similar experience with AirPods. Apple Watch is a great little accessory which allows you to not just have a 'mini phone on your wrist', but also show a little bit of your personality and I love the pride watch straps. After-sales service is simply outstanding, had an issue with an iPhone just outside of warranty, took it to my local Apple Store and was repaired for free. Phone staff are really helpful and opening hours are impressive, even had an issue with HomePod on Christmas Day resolved very quickly and efficiently. Really recommend Apple all around, and will never look back.\", 'very pleased.Mikaela made me do this, I hope to receive more phone calls and invites for mancala.', 'waiting for the latest wear pro and till dat emy services have been great', 'I had a problem with my iPhone.

My kids had a consistent Apple IPAD Charger challenges. All efforts to rectify this became a pain in the bum because my kids so stressed me out to fix it. Fom one roadside charger to another and not working afterwards.Until I thought why not go to Apple directly, whom I bought both IPADs from. I popped into 02 Store in Woolwich and asked for Apple IPAD chargers. The agent told me both chargers would set me aback by ¬£48. I screamed because I had been used to buying roadside chargers for ¬£10 max, which stopped working a week after. I took the risk and bought both chargers for ¬£48 and for the next 7 months, I had respite from my kids - no more charger challenge anymore, until recently when both chargers stopped working and all hell was let lose. My kids are so used to their IPADs the way I am so used to my smart phone. So I know what they are going through each time they can't get their IPAD to work. I went back to the 02 store for warranty replacement and was told to contact Apple directly. I did and Apple fixed an appointment for me to pop into their nearest store at Stratford to get the items replaced. I visited apple Stratford and got both chargers replaced, bran new without any questions.At Apple shop Stratford, I was not only wowed by their excellent customer service amidst a huge endless crowd, I was bowled over by Apples display of a vast array of 21st century gadgets, ranging from smart iPhones to tablets and PCs.And I remembered Steve Jobs of blessed memory and his subsisting legacy, the Apple brand. May he continue to RIP. I advise all and sundry, should you ever wish to purchase, any smart phones, tablets and PCs, please go to Apple for quality, and after care service. Because you have purchased from Apple, (any product, even outside waranty) Apple will continue to look after you and that product for life. Eg 2 IPADs (8 generation- 2020) I bought for my kids at the cost of ¬£450 each... Even when it was outside warranty when my younger daughter (8yr old) had her screen broken, Apple offered me same product, bran new replacement at the cost of ¬£200 (which I considered to be a very ridiculous PRIZE).No seller out there will do similar.Hence I said if you must buy any smart phones, tablet or PCs, for Quality and your own peace of mind, pls buy ONLY from Apple cos Apple will look after u and your product for life... Now, that's just a thought on Apple, Steve Jobs legacy..May he continue to RIP.\", 'Date of experience: April 01, 2023', 'Great Products', 'Date of experience: March 03, 2023', 'The perfect ecosystem', 'Date of experience: June 30, 2023', 'Date of experience: May 12, 2023', 'Apple products and services are really great, in the last few years those they have lagged but mostly they are good.', \"I gave up on Apple after a horrendous Apple Store experience.

Wouldn‚Äôt use another brand, because none come close to apple.Regarding the negative reviews about customer support, you need to ask for a senior advisor or tech support for any issues beyond the basics. Apple has massively grown but instead of dropping support like most companies do, they are actually hiring new reps, from diverse backgrounds, some of whom are new apple users. They don‚Äôt have to offer so much support, but apple is pretty incredible. That‚Äôs why so many of us are addicted. Their products are the best available, and the company culture goes above and beyond.So there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll get one of these polite reps who are well trained but don‚Äôt know instinctively about the products like the original apple nerd support. It‚Äôs going to take time to develop because apple no longer hires exclusively amazing nerds with incredible knowledge and pleasant personalities. Possibly because they can‚Äôt find enough of them and still maintain diversity.But you can always request a senior advisor or tech support which pretty much guarantees that stellar apple experience, while waiting for the newbies to develop.', 'Best iPhone ever , my all family have it now', 'A one - happy today with my purchase', 'Great service from Apple online store where I purchased a refurbished Apple iphone.The iPhone arrived from the Apple online store by courier DPS the NEXT day during the allocated time slot given to me by text UNLIKE the courier DHL who are terrible.

It‚Äôs got the power, the versatility to be a lot of things and it feels very premium, even with the MagSafe case it looks and feels amazing.I don‚Äôt often get excited about using a device but it‚Äôs a genuine enjoyment to use the 13 pro max on a day to day basis.Great job Apple, keep up the good work!', 'apple care plus fantastic service broke screen on new iphone 13 replace phone and replaced the ¬£50 apple case which had damage as well just ¬£25 excess', 'Angel, from Apple Support, was an absolute joy to talk to.

I called and reported my watch was no longer working.  They spoke nice and told me they would send me a box to return the watch in for fixing.  I waited for 2 days and called back.  Next person explained the order was cancelled and they were not sure why.  I purchased the Apple Care Plan at the time of the purchase of the watch and phone.  It is worth it also and kept all receipts to verify my purchases.  This was quite frustrating.  However, after about 8 days, the customer service office told me to go to the nearest store to turn the watch in for repair.  It took about 8 days to get it back, because they had to examine the watch to see if it was something I did to the watch to keep it from working.  Well, the store in Sugar Land Texas, First Colony Mall was quite helpful and kind and courteous.   That is when I was notified when I arrived to pick up my watch that they actually replaced the watch with A BRAND NEW APPLE WATCH 6.  Praise God Almighty!

I still have my iPhone 4 which is the best looking apple phone they ever made. My last purchase was a HomePod Mini, which I love, not as good as the Echo devices but still a very nice gadget. Siri is not the brightest unfortunately, but let‚Äôs hope Apple rectify this. The HomePod was shipped and delivered earlier than expected, which I was over the moon with. In all the years I have been buying apple products I have never had an issue. I am now looking at a new iPad and possibly a iMac mini or a MacBook Air.', 'I have been an Apple customer since my first computer. Since that day I have always gotten great service and support.

She was super friendly, understood my problem, and sent me to Ricky, another fantastic Genius Bar technician!   Ead and Ricky are both amazing people who offered me a fresh new iPhone 13. Aman, the sales guy, was even more gracious, providing a free ¬£50 iPhone 13 cover! These three team  are true gems who are a valuable asset to the company.

I spent over 1 hour on the phone to an amazing lady. She listened, helped me with account recovery on my daughters phone. It only took 3 days till the account password was regained. The information  she gave both to me aswell as step by step instructions on how I could do this. Amazing service. Very prompt. Very Very impressed with the ease they put me at as I was frantic when I rang. I would tell people who have any issues with their device to contact apple care. They quicken up the process and make it easy and stress free to help and solve problems. We'll done.\", \"I know there seems to be a general consensus of negative reviews on here about Apple but I wanted to come on here and commend their applecare/customer service based on my recent experience. After getting my month old new Iphone 11 pickpocketed at a market in London, I submitted a claim with applecare theft and loss. I had only a month before had my previous (very old and smashed) Iphone stolen from me, which was not insured with applecare. This prompted me to take the precaution to purchase the theft and loss package when I bought my Iphone 11. The applecare claim process was very quick and straightforward via an online form format. Once I submitted the claim online, I called customer services to ensure I'd done everything right and that it had been submitted properly. They were extremely helpful and I received my new phone two days later. I would definitely recommend investing in the Applecare Theft/loss package especially if you live anywhere in or like London. Phone theft is rife but this experience put me at ease that apple will get things sorted if it happens for a third time (hoping it won't) !\", 'About 12 years ago, I started using Apple phones with the 3gs iPhone. I buy a new iPhone almost every year, but each phone provides 3-4 years of service as my wife and children use \\'hand me downs\\' when I change.  Yes, an annual iPhone shuffle! :) During these 12 years, I\\'ve used over ten different iPhones, and NOT ONE has presented a problem that Apple didn\\'t promptly resolve.  Most never had any issue.  I\\'ve sometimes wondered if the extended warranty has been necessary, but I think it is worthwhile for the duration we use them!  I\\'ve also purchased an iMac, Macbook Pro, AirPods, iPad, AirPod Pro, and other devices.  It hasn\\'t been all smooth sailing across all these devices, but on the rare occasion I\\'ve faced issues, Apple has always taken pride in resolving them to my satisfaction. I\\'m pragmatic and believe problems and electronics are inevitable.  What matters to me is the frequency and how they resolve issues when they do arise.  In that regard, Apple set the standard for consumer electronics. I recently had an event where I inquired about an out-of-warranty device issue. Apple support engaged me comprehensively and ultimately replaced the item FOC (Free Of Charge) as it \"Didn\\'t meet their standards\".  I went to their service centre expecting to spend and came away with a free replacement.  That only comes from an organisation that will stand by its products.I started as an Apple II computer user in the late \\'80s and, after a lengthy break, joined their Mac world in 2012.  Since then, I\\'ve enjoyed the Apple echo system, which prioritises my needs and privacy.  I consider alternatives occasionally, but I currently see no serious contender.  Ease of use, reliability, longevity and delivering a complete package is all part of the reasoning behind my conclusion.If you consider Apple\\'s pricing versus what they deliver holistically, I believe they are not the most costly.  It can be hard to differentiate purchase price from cost over a device\\'s life, but you will not be disappointed when you can take that step!', 'Consistently great! You get what you pay for.', 'Great company, I love my iphone! Would never go back', 'I got a new iPhone 13.

Justin was extremely patient and took great pains to ensure that my queries had been answered, going beyond the call of duty to give me advice as to where I could purchase a new battery in UK for my Apple Iphone.  He carried out a diagnostics test which clarified why my iPhone was not working properly and gave me suggestions and his considered opinion as to what my best course of action should be.  As I am 75-year old pensioner and not very technically-savvy, his guidance was invaluable and he assured me throughout our conversation that he was only doing his job in taking the time and making the effort to solve my problem.

Guilt trip on being able to detect COVID, don't like the direction the watches have taken detecting falls, believe it should be an optional feature at best, but then again I have the series 6. The watch seems a little gimmicky for the overall cost especially VS resale and how much use it might not see.

But what I love most about my Mac is the OS; My impression is that Windows computers are built around the _computer_ whereas Macs are built around the human.

Well just recently I made my dream come true and bought the new Mini Mac. Why did I wait so long? It's a pleasure to use, supper fast. I have taken to it like a duck to water. I didn't get the apple screen, they seem very expensive compared to others. I went for a 4K Samsung screen which is clear enough for my needs and less then half the cost of the Apple screen. I have loaded my photo programs for editing photographs etc. and the mini mac races through any task thrown it's way. No more waiting time, no waiting at start up etc. Can't comment on customer service as everything has fitted into place without any problems. Not bad for a 70 year old.

Could not have asked for better service MANY THANKS <3', \"I'm surprised that there are so many negative comments about customer service. I've been purchasing Apple and Windows products for 15 years and Apple have always treated me well. I had a Sony Vaio that was constantly plagued with problems (wifi, keyboard, screen, battery, trackpad) and would spend 8 weeks at a time being serviced by Sony (thats how long it took them to repair any issue I had). Since these issues didnt all arise at once I would send it in for repair and wait 2 months to get it back only to have used it for a few days until a new issue would pop up and the cycle repeated. I ended up shoving the laptop at the back of my closet in frustration and Sony would go on to cease making laptops altogether. My next purchase was a 13 inch Macbook Pro in 2017 that served me well over the years with no issues until recently. One was the problematic keyboard that many complained about (thankfully the new 2020 models don't have this issue any more). The second problem I had was with the screen. In an act of rage i slammed the lid on my Macbook with great force because of some bad news I received and the screen went completely black and would'nt turn on. My Macbook was just out of warranty and I was worried it would cost me a fortune to fix. I took it in to the Apple store in Chatswood for repair and they replaced my keyboard for free and they replaced my screen and didn't charge me for the parts (which is not cheap and can cost anywhere between $400-$1200 for a new screen). Apple only charged me $149 for the service fee. Since my warranty was void Apple could have charged me for every piece i needed repaired if they wanted to. However, they were kind enough to supply the parts free and only charge me the service fee. This goes to show that Apple does really care about customer satisfaction.

Sooner I switched all my devices to Apple, this made my life a lot easier. No ecosystems can compare with Apple's.\", 'I am shocked by the number of bad ratings about Apple so would like to add my own opinion and hopefully help to level things out.I have owned a MacBook Pro for some years now and when I purchased it I took out AppleCare. It ran out many years ago but when I call Apple for help the service is second to none. I am not very technologically inclined but they always help me if I get stuck by taking over my screen (with no access to my content I hasten to say) and very soon set me back on the right path. If the service person hasn‚Äôt enough knowledge for my particular problem they refer it to a specialist and I have never, in about seven years, been let down. They are never in a hurry and will spend as much time as is needed to resolve any problems. This service is why I would never purchase anything but Apple and can absolutely recommend the products, especially for  people like me (I am 82) who do need a bit of help with technology.I still have my MacBook Pro but my IPad is a dinosaur so I decided to upgrade to an 11‚Äù 2020 I Pad Pro. I really like the photo editing software on my MacBook Pro and had checked the editing on I Pads over the past couple of years and found it to be lacking and so delayed upgrading my I Pad.Now that I have taken the plunge I am glad I waited because the new 2020  IPad Pro has brilliant photo editing software and once I get used to it I think it will be even better than the MacBook Pro editing software. When on holiday (If we ever get any of those again) it means that I can do everything I need on my new IPad  I will not need to take a laptop. I have also lashed out on the Magic Keyboard and am loving it. It is easier to take around the house than my MacBook Pro because the combined weight of the IPad and the keyboard is far lighter than the MacBook Pro.It is excellent for emails etc but my other hobby is writing and I think I will probably stay with Pages on my MacBook Pro for that because it is less sensitive when typing. But then again, I might be finding it sensitive because I am not yet ‚Äòacclimatised‚Äô to the Magic Keyboard size.

I call Apple in a panic since this project will be viewed in 1 week and it has taken 6 weeks to get to this point. Not only do they remote into your computer....but they try everything. We were blessed to have Casandra - Senior Advisor, help us out. She had us copy files which would take 4 hours and told us she would call back to go to step 2 before she left for the evening. Not only did she call us back but she stayed over her time to make sure that she restored the entire project for us. That is over and above the word \"support\".

I tried reseting it myself but after a day it was still throwing the code. I got onto an online chat with Apple support and it was the fastest and smoothest replacement I've ever had with any product- especially from an online chat. Within five minutes I had them ready to send me a new watch and it even shipped less than 12 hours later! If you want a watch I highly recommend the extra $50 for AppleCare because it was a lifesaver and all I have to do is wait for my new one and send them my old one back! Very satisfied and very impressed with how smooth this all is.\", \"I have real issues with understanding the problems people have had with Apple.  As a family we have now gone over to Apple totally (phones, lap tops, desk tops and pads).  Buying from the Apple Store has always been quick, efficient and friendly, and I have yet to find anything out of stock (that's 6 laptops, 2 desk tops, 9 phones and 4 iPads over the past 7 years).  The products last well and have only been replaced due to damage or loss (two laptops, one iPad  and 1 phone) or upgrades in the case of phones (all of the computers still run well).  We have had very few technical issues and the odd ones we have had have be dealt with quickly and free by the Apple store!  Example today (upgrading my wife's MacAir) - we'd like a new mac air please, certainly madam give me two minutes, job done.  We are thinking of having the old one serviced to give to our son, how much do you charge (it is over 5 years old)? Oh nothing madam, let me pop it upstairs while you wait and they will clean the fan and keyboard and check the version of the software and do a virus check while we get the details sorted for your new machine. Fifteen minute later - all done, but we have noticed a slight flaw in your screen on the coating...  Ahh... is that a problem, sounds expensive.  We will need to put a new screen on... sounds very expensive.  No - although it is out of warranty (by a century or so!) this should never happen and we will do it for free - we will need the machine for a couple of hours while you have coffee...  Now - if that is not service what is?  My experience with Sony (my pre-Apple computer of choice) was a disaster.  They would side step every fault (in warranty) where possible unless threatened with legal action and took on average 6 weeks to fix anything.  Apple 10, Sony nil.  I wouldn't buy anything but Apple now.. They are very good, they are expensive, but the service we have had has been faultless and fast.\", \"I'm a longstanding, loyal customer of Apple and I never needed any repairs or service, until three weeks ago.

I didn't get seen to and became very angry as since I was a walk in appointment and was told I would only be seen to if someone was free but aside from that I got ignored.I then went in the evening after work where I said that this is my 3rd time and needed my phone to work or something to be sorted. Luckily a kind fella said ok that's fine and was very apologetic, offered me a seat and then just explained that within 20 minutes someone would be out. Luckily enough a girl named Katherine came out and helped me with my issue. We had a nice chat and due to her discretion of me since my phone wasn't in bad condition, she kindly gave me a replacement phone and waived the fee even though it was out of warranty!!!! I can't thank Katherine and the store enough as now I am sorted and it's like my old phone never broke.I see the negative comments and understand that but in my own experience I can't think of any other company who would be so kind to give a free phone out of warranty!! Thank you!!! :D\", \"Most people complain about Apple but still have an iPhone, iPad etc.  Most problems arise from not understanding how to use these devices therefore most people complain about what is essentially their own error in not backing up the device properly before updating etc.  I use Apple devices for business and the way iCloud syncs is brilliant! They are simple to use, easy and very user friendly! I've also found their customer service to be of a very high standard too. Of course it has its problems but nothing is perfect but I'd never go back to anything Windows again if I could help it. MS anything is clunky, slow, updates every two mins when you least need them when needing to finish an important report etc. Plus a nightmare to back up and restore! Why can't everything be as simple as Apple! Technology should be fun, not require a degree in rocket science to work first. Yes they are expensive and work needs to be done to make things more affordable but hats off to apple for making computing fun and stylish again.

As a non-techie with copious reservations, I was pleased with the service that I received from salespeople Cristina Twitty and Brian Velez.  My visit started with Cristina, who is the consummate professional.  She was extremely patient with me.  My past experiences with laptops have been so dire that I was left skeptical about spyware and malware and the whole internet experience.  I had many questions, and although she answered all of them, she didn't mind, and even encouraged, my asking all the questions that I needed to before investing in my purchase.   She answered all of my questions until she was absolutely sure that I understood all the points.  She went beyond the call of duty by going to different Apple experts to explain certain points to me to ascertain that I understood what my purchase of a MacBook Air entailed.  My concern was mostly about malicious spyware and malware, and she asked several experts to explain everything to me until she felt that I was comfortable with my imminent purchase.  I left the store assured that I made the best purchase.  Cristina's selling savvy was stellar!  Then she made sure that Brian Velez introduced me to my MacBook Air.  Brian was a joy to learn from, and he was so patient with me.  His great disposition put me at ease, and he also answered all of my questions while teaching me how to navigate my new MacBook.  He was a delight!  Both salespeople were beautiful spirits that I had the pleasure of learning from.  I have  never had such a pleasant experience making a purchase.

They may be a little late to getting their products environmentally responsible, but again, true top Apple, they pushed the standards high and have achieved amazing results!  Some techies may feel like Apple doesn't relate to them.  That's okay - this company has certainly captured MY heart!\\r They've also captured my pocket book.

When you buy one of the others you expect to put it in the bin in 12 months because you've spent half your life waiting for some customer support to tell you why it won't start or why it keeps crashing.\\r If you buy an Apple computer you only buy it once if you buy something else it will break more times than it works, and if all you  have against it is the fact it is updated every year remember, thats progress if Apple didn't update its products every year and keeps its customers happy you would call it a PC or worse still it would be called Windows!\", 'I have 4 different ipods and they are all awsome.

No one gave a thought to App Store or iTunes, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there were other computer programs inferior to apple's and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise.

If you can find Apple product at a discount they are closure to a good value. Last gen products and Apple refurbished products are also a good value. Third party Apple retailers generally offer better deals. Apple has really moved to a closed off ecosystem having all devices now use Apple chips. They also skew performance figures to make their chips look better. They are very good but nothing magical about Apples hardware other than Apples is more closed off and more difficult to compare to other hardware makers. You buy Apple products you buy into Apple and its ecosystem. A lot of times this is beneficial but it‚Äôs not without feeling some exclusiveness from the rest of the Windows and Android world. Connecting with other Apple users is straightforward but have friends with Windows PC or Android devices? Yeah not so much. Genius Bar help is hit or miss too, some are actually good and some clearly are not so well trained. Myself I don‚Äôt have a nearby Apple Store so I rely more on solving issues with community help and chat with Apple support. It‚Äôs ok but hardly what I would call super helpful basically going through what any support would do with redundant tests and basically resetting everything. Apple support seems coached to never admit a common issue many are having. It is what it is and you probably have better results talking to a Genius at a Apple Store.', 'Recently purchased the Apple Watch Ultra, and although it is definitely a step-up on the Series 7, the fitness tracking is still too unreliable.Despite doing a number of runs both outdoors and indoors, the watch is always way behind on tracked distance. As an example, I have just finished a 10km run on a treadmill, yet the watch has tracked it as 8.12km. Apple suggests running outdoors so that the watch can re-calibrate. Have done this a number of times and still no luck. A simple solution would be to give you the option to alter the tracked distance, much like other companies like Garmin allow. Really don‚Äôt understand why Apple have never released such a simple solution.If you‚Äôre after a fitness watch, I‚Äôd strongly recommend Polar or Garmin.

Apple used to make a lasting, quality product. My 5S was kicking for 5+ years. It was still working when I retired it for a 2020 SE after they started zapping battery life on old models (I don‚Äôt buy the explanation they fed us on that one by the way). Now they make them to last 2 years max. I hardly use my phone (texts and light browsing) and it just drains. If I‚Äôm sleeping and it‚Äôs unplugged, it can easily die on its own. Well, the old ‚Äúinferior‚Äù 5S battery didn‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs a shame their only goal is to sell as many devices as possible - that‚Äôs inherently unethical. I recommend looking up a list of what goes into making a smart phone. There are limited amounts of the elements required to produce electronic devices and smart phones on the earth. There is no game plan to recycle these precious metals from existing devices, slow down, or cease mining for these. Instead, every year there‚Äôs a new iPhone, regardless of how piddling and insubstantial the updates are on it. I am not advocating a Luddite, phoneless existence - I am just asking Apple be reasonable and build fewer, enduring products instead of a frenzied existence of endlessly churning out new products to make shareholders richer. Since my SE 2020 isn‚Äôt faring well, I stepped into an Apple Store to look at current offerings the other day. When I mentioned I was interested in an older model, the sales associated pretended to look shocked and said, ‚Äúare you ok being X # of phones behind?‚Äù. What an awful sales tactic- trying to shame or pressure customers to buy the latest and greatest, to be ‚Äúin‚Äù on the hype.

Because of this policy, a phone that still works well cannot get the new OS required for other app updates. This is, to me, a FORCED CASH SPEND and it is also environmentally irresponsible. With this policy Apple consigns thousands of phones to the dump creating waste when they would not be there if people could get the latest OS update and be able to then properly use the third-party apps like InstaGram. Times are economically tough around the world these days. Why force people to spend unnecessarily? Why create more waste with phones sent to the dumpster when that waste is unecessary and can be fixed with a simple policy change allowing OS updates? As then Prince Charles said \"plastic has been placed on the menu\". Apple is placing more of it on the menu with this draconian policy of not allowing OS updates on older phone models like the iPhone5S. I would accept a small fee to update the OS on the iPhone 5S, but should not be forced to consign a working phone to landfill and spend new money on hardware just for an OS upgrade so I can properly use third-party apps.', \"I like Apple product.

Now I don‚Äôt have that money in my bank account or the available credit on my card.

Especially after the loss of Steve Jobs, it seems that they became a company who is not focused anymore to user experience as before, but rather a company who is constantly trying to earn more and more without providing in return that much to their Clients. The quality of their products decreased dramatically as well, especially for certain types of products. For example we had to trash 6 AirPods because they became unusable after 2 years. The durability of some of their products are limited almost to the warranty period. After that they deteriorate dramatically or they become unusable. Lastly I purchased or had to purchase a new AirPods Gen 3 due to Apple Ecosystem I am involved in and they are falling out of my ear.

I came to the conclusion that some Apple-sheep can't understand technology and trends, therefore they can't even compare.To mention I never had before an Apple product.1. Bought an iPhone 13 mini. Lovely phone. Good for calling. Not good for writing messages (for my medium sized hands). I was kinda disappointed to see that the iOS is far from perfection, as it's marketed. Had lots of freezing, apps error and closing, hangings on loading iOS apps (not those from App Store). So there is went the myth with the perfect smartphone OS. I liked though that I could hear calls a bit better than on an Android smartphone I'm using in parallel. The speaker also sounds more bassy...2. AirPods 3rd Gen: I like them, they sound good, but not very loud. The battery depleted by itself many times, when not used. So I must charge them every week or so. I use some Huawei mostly, because they connect to two devices at once. The AirPods can't do that. And it's annoying.3. MacBook Air M1 (8GB, 256GB): I liked the MacOS. Mostly a good experience for programming, browsing, multimedia. Good speakers. But something I wasn't expecting: if (and I do lots of times) I have too many tabs opened in the browser, the browser (at least) freezes completely. I must to Force Quit the app from the Task Manager or what's called. When the RAM is full many apps are hanging too and it becomes useless. And I can't upgrade the RAM. And to buy 32GBs of RAM unit is out of discussion. It's extremely expensive. I'll have my Lenovo Legion 5 with 64GB of RAM and 3TBs on SSDs doing the hard job. Ahh, forgot: compared to Windows, waking the MacBook from sleeping mode happens instantly. This is really nice.4. iPad Mini 6 WiFi 64GB/ 5G & WiFi 256GB: bought the WiFi version to use it for navigation, as compared to an Android tablet it takes both Apple Maps and Google Maps (both they do great job). Learned the expensive way that the WiFi version doesn't have a GPS module. Lol. The cheapest possible Android tablet I ever had, it had GPS. You just tether your smartphone's WiFi and voil√†, you have internet on the tablet. Not on the WiFi version of this iPad Mini 6. So had to buy the Cellular version again. The latest works just fine. Lags sometimes with both navigation apps opened on split screen, but it's ok.5. iPad Pro 11 M1 2021 (8GB RAM, 128GB ROM): bought this for gaming and it's a monster. I even edited some videos and this thing is fast. Bought for my brother the Galaxy Tab S8 (8GB RAM, 256GB ROM, 5G) and the Samsung has more options for the user (Samsung DEX at least) and it came with a keyboard AND the pen. All for under 600¬£ with student price. Anyway, I still like iPad Pro. I bought a Logitech keyboard, as the original is way too expensive to worth. I'd buy the pen, but 120¬£? Really?Anyway, to end my review for Apple: it's just another company trying to lure the customers into buying their products. It's all about the money. But it's far from any perfection some fans are bragging. Before buying the 13 Mini, I bought a SE202 to see how's an iPhone. I had AppleCare+ for it. And sold it, but cancelling the Coverage can't be done through Apple platform. Must call them and it's hugely annoying. It's not something straight.\", 'Iphone is the best phone out there.

I\\'ve had Mac Book Pro\\'s (my latest Mac Book Pro  is 10 years old and other than it won\\'t undate anymore without it stopping altogether it\\'s been great)  I\\'ve had numerous iPad\\'s and iPhones and 2 Apple Watches.    I\\'ve bought iPads and iPhones for my kids and grandkids as well as myself.Last year while I was home in the States I bought an iPhone 13 Pro.   It has lasted a year and it died completely, fortunately I had apple care and they replaced my phone.   I also spent over $1000 buying an iPad Pro in 2019, that charger has also failed.   The apple symbol comes on for now when I turn it on but despite trying every charging port in the house and other houses, and buying new charging cables, it will not charge anymore.    I just looked to see how much it would cost to fix it and it seems that they\\'re quoting ¬£570 (I\\'m in the UK at the moment)    So my question is has Apple really \"gone downhill\" with their products?   I am going to the States shortly again and I was going to buy another MacBook and now it looks like iPad as well.   I guess the lesson learned is that you have to pay the Apple care monthly plan, if you do the annual plan you only get an extra year of cover.

I own an iMac 2019 Intel desktop, iPhone 14 Pro max, iPad 11\" Pro, M2 Pro Mac Mini, and a series 7 Apple watch, and a heap of accessories all of which are Apple branded. The iPhone and the iPad are about the best of the eco system. I wanted to award Apple only one star but admittedly some of their products are quite good. My focus of this review is more to do with the iMac 2019 and the Mac Mini. The 2019 intel iMac came with host of unforeseen issues, I bought this computer because I am disabled / diabetic etc, and the university recommended an Apple computer as it would come preloaded with software to assist me in completing a Masters degree. The software on the desktop did not work and to get it to work like it should have, there were additional steps that neither me or the tutor who came to my home were aware of, it was an added layer of a learning curve to which I did not need at a time when I required a computer that was supposedly easy to use. After I had completed my second degree successfully, the search for employment began, as you would expect, in the time that I have had the iMac desktop I have lost 4 job opportunities, this is due to the way MS Teams that for some unknown reason locks into a weird loop when there is an attempt to use it, when you speak to Apple Tech support they tell you that due to MS Teams being a third party software that it has nothing to do with them, it is like Apple is not designed to run third party softwares which everyone knows that is complete and utter rubbish, the real reason for them not assisting is because they do not know about their own product well enough to advise accordingly. The iMac desktop issues did not end there, saving MS Word documents became an ordeal as well, because for some reason, the amendments would not save and when they did the entire document was lost somewhere in a file. So iMac desktop is garbage, and the tech support is not much better, they will fob you at a drop of a hat, to get out of doing a job they are paid for! Then we come to the Mac Mini which was an infuriating buys experience - this is surrounding the compatibility of displays, mainly their own 2019 iMac desktop display. Apple has removed the Target Display Mode from before 2014 so the iMac 2019 cannot be used a display for the Mac Mini, this is a fact, and it was something that was constantly contradicted between tech support at Apple and, Apple\\'s own website, no one knew, no one knows, I had to dig up YouTube videos where other buys of this device confirmed that the Mac mini 2023 cannot be used with a 2019 Apple display, ironically, the Mac mini will work with any other display brand ... like Samsung?????? And it will definitely work along side the 1600 quid Mac Studio display, and it will work with any Mac desktop from BEFORE 2014. By then I had already bought and paid for this device, I am going on for teacher training early next year and I need an updated computer that will serve my current eco system so it was an arm twist in having to buy this device. The thing with Apple is that their claims on their own products are stated in half sentences or omitted completely, this serves as misleading and contemptible. If you buy a desktop with Apple make sure you do all of the back ground research before opting to pay for it. I have yet to feel delight, joy and satisfaction with an Apple product without having to buy this, that and the other for it to get proper functionality out of the device. When compared to Android, Microsoft - Apple\\'s only advantage is in its security features and built in privacy, but then as a consumer you should expect this due to Apple Pay. I have taken Apple to the ASA over what I truly believe to be a misleading sale on the Mac mini computer. There was one problem with the iPhone 12 Pro Max that I owned a last year before upgrading, the screen display for some peculiar reason magnified, the phone became inoperable as a result, in an attempt to get the handset back to normal the phone automatically called the Police three times, in the end the local constabulary contacted me to issue a formal warning that if I attempted any further hoax calls I would be subject to a prosecution! Jony Ives says using iPhone is \"intuitive\" that is his way of saying that it is common sense - I can tell you there was nothing intuitive about having to revive a screen on a phone that had by itself enlarged the display, for what reason would you require this feature on a handset? I had to use three fingers, then tap, and the screen would restore itself- not exactly intuitive if you didnt know. I find Jony Ives word insulting and compounds my feelings of raging hate towards Apple fully justified.', 'I got a new phone because I unfortunately smashed my old one.

I was then told to contact Apple to see would they authorise the repair but was passed to a manager who was very quick to tell me that I had mentioned European consumer law to one of his customer service agents and it was a legal process and they must adhere to the law. He clearly stated that Apple should have been informed within the two years but as I previously wrote above I incorrectly thought the warranty kicks in on activation. He did offer a replacement at approximately the cost of a new watch but I politely declined. If a two year warranty is a legal matter for Apple then why are their authorised sellers offering two year warranties. I would just encourage anyone thinking of buying an apple product to make themselves very familiar with the Apple warranty ( and what is included ) , it‚Äôs starting date and also their rights under European law. I would encourage consumers to contact Apple if they have any issues with their apple products well within their warranty period and to clarify if they are entitled to the extended warranty under European law ( at no cost ).

I had something quite unique with an Intel MacBook Pro appearing to overhear. The person I dealt with by phone and in store both went out of their way to help me. Hopefully the issue is resolved. So why not five stars? Because back in the day, I wouldn't have had to contact them as things 'just worked'.. Apple certainly had dropped quality standards slightly.

They were fine but no better than cheaper alternatives and on one front a lot worse. The batteries in both died after very moderate usage. Nine years on I purchased an Ipad. Tried to log on to the Apple system but as I did not remember my password or old phone number it was impossible. I gave up after much frustration. I will say my Ipad is excellent more six years on the battery holds its charge for months. Recently I purchased two reconditioned ipods to listen to Audible books. Audible decided to close their Windows app that worked with the iPod. The replacement turns out to only work with the latest iPod. This was a fact I discovered after four hours of trying to sort out my password only to have to get a new account with a new email address. Then I had to fill in a lengthy form on the iPod's tiny screen and the keypad designed for the finger size of a three year old.Six months ago I considered an iPhone purchase but then remembered how difficult Apple make it to carry out the simplest process (eg.

The review should (and would) be FIVE STAR, if it wasn't for some of Apple's apparent intransigence.Feedback below given to Apple on a recent interaction.The advisor Kevin was great, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The system somewhat less so. Firstly, the automated system is not fit for purpose in any way shape or form! Considering where we are present day, with voice recognition, your automated system seems rooted somewhere in the late 1980s! It never has any idea what is being requested, which always results in me (and probably many others) just shouting obscenities at it! And then normally ending up at the wrong department, therefore wasting an advisor's time and further frustrating valued customers!Secondly, and even more importantly, I have all my music (a lifetime's music) purchased legitimately, so therefore mine, to do whatever I wish, within the realms of the law, that is now stuck on my iPhone and cannot be transferred back to my very expensive, new, top of the range custom order iMac!!! This is due to my old iMac, just stopping working! There needs to be an easy way to recover data from a malfunctioning Mac and more importantly, Apple need to make available the sort of 3rd party programmes that there are out there, for eventualities such as this! Please listen to your customers! We are personally, Apple aficionados, we have EVERY Apple product there is! We intend to stay Apple customers for ever, but that doesn't mean that we will. How can Apple leave some of their best customers (ie best advertising stream) feeling frustrated and angry? Come on Apple, must do better for the customers that you already have, and then, spend the astronomical budgets attracting others. Word of mouth and customer satisfaction is KING! Perhaps (if you don't already have) create a pool of committed, confirmed Apple users, for genuine feedback, instead of a bunch of highly paid statistic massagers!

Two weeks ago I visited the Apple Store in Booragoon Perth to have my screen fixed. The screen was fixed in about an hour and the phone was ready at the promised time.

When I went back to the store at the promised time to collect the phone, it wasn‚Äôt ready and I was directed to a table to wait. This table had no chairs and I waited 30 mins, then found someone to chase up my phone and the phone arrived, all fine and the speaker issue fixed but no screen protector, so this was then done. At all times the Apple team were lovely. BUT at no point did anyone applogise for the inconvenience to me of having to take time out of my day and drive an hour back to the store, nor did they apologise for having me wait 30 mins past my promised pick up time nor did they apologise for not having the screen protector done as promised. I‚Äôm a long time Apple lover, with 20 Apple products at my business but I just felt that an apology or a glass of water while waiting or a regular check in while I was waiting would have gone a long way.

My only options are, taking time from my busy day to drive to one of your stores. Or wait for a package to get in the mail, send the product to them. Wait for them to fix it, and then wait for them to ship it back to me. This makes sense when it's an older product, but when it's a new product, I really can't understand why it can't get replaced. Why is it so hard for apple to mail me a new product and give the return label to return the old product. That's what Samsung does.\", \"Poor Sport Loop Band design for apple watch. Quick version: Recommend do not buy it. And no leniency from support. Long version: Bought a new watch with said strap for partner. Strap kept coming loose and after only a few days does so again, watch drops and cracks screen on impact with the ground. Looked online to find similar customer experiences. Complained to apple that strap was not fit for purpose with description, supplied photos, her appleID so they can see her brand loyalty,  who has been buying their overpriced stuff for 10 yrs if not more.Replied and said there was insufficient evidence to make a claim. Why, as fate would have it, on this occasion we weren't video-recording her wrist walking from A to B. I didn't expect them to replace or offer free or even lower priced repair as a gesture of goodwill but good to confirm and seal the suspicion and disappointment.Why try to redesign the wheel? Have been wearing real watches all my life and never had a strap which failed to keep the watch where it should be, hence this 'design' is not worthy of the name, though maybe that's why they couldn't call it a strap.

I converted from PCs to Macs in 2005 and use Apple products constantly now. I keep them regularly updated to the latest models. As I do so I am continually dissatisfied with what I find. I could write a list of dislikes that would fill many pages. In the past few months I upgraded my iMac to a 2020 model from a 2014 model, expecting it to be a whiz-bang. It is not. My feeling is that I have not improved my situation one iota. That move cost me ¬£2000. In the past week I upgraded my MacBook Pro from a 2018 model to a 2021 model and I feel the same. I thought  the new M1 chip would be transformational. It is not. There are too many points of dissatisfaction to list them all here, though I would do so if asked. Where has all the speed gone? The security aspects of setting up new hardware are horrendous. Even the once-simple process of migrating has become a nightmare. As an IT professional, I cannot see how ordinary people cope with all this! My MacBook Pro cost me ¬£1800 and the cash back for a trade-in was ¬£240. This is really not worth it. I have had constant issues with the OS - constantly being asked to put in passwords and security codes. This is all SO unsatisfactory.

Frequent useless updates that tend to remove and hide features. Old tutorials that are just months old often lead you to nowhere. There was a setting in Pinyin Chinese that allows the mac to ignore the letter \\'g\\', after the update, I can\\'t find it (I went to the Apple Store and they still can\\'t find it).2. Disorganized file structure. It may seem clean at first, but if you are trying to delete all files related to a software like Xcode, you will find there are hundreds of them laying in many different folders. You can delete some of them. For others you can\\'t even move them. And the Apple technician told me to delete all of them.3. Equating unreliable new features as innovation. For whatever reason, my touchbar flashes about every 1 minute. And there is the butterfly keyboard that jams and typessss several characters at a time.4. Slow and unprofessional support. So I tried to use the Apple Care to solve some of those issues. I tried to chat with them online 1st but they are not specialized in Xcode (my 2nd pt). I scheduled and went to an Apple shop and that person is still not specialized. They said they would call back and email me, but absolutely nothing happened. I ended up factory reset my mac after spending hours trying to do what I said in pt 2.5. Child porn iPhone news. No elaboration needed.6. Frequent slowing down of speed (for mac) accompanied by loud sound of the fans and heating up. Sometimes random weird stuff would happen if you haven\\'t restarted your mac for some time like Finder deciding you have no permission to open and change files you created. It is not a secret that Apple slows down old models before releasing new models of iPhone.7. Doesn\\'t support most games.8. Bluetooth feature (between mac and iPhone) that doesn\\'t work most of the time. It all depends on the mood of the mac if it lets your iPhone find it and airdrop a file.9. App issues.

Are these bugs designed to spy on us? I really don't get it. Ever since Steve Jobs died, it seems that Apple is run by greedy adult children who no longer innovate, but infiltrate. It took a bit getting used to iOS Big Sur, (being a fan of the older 80s & 90s software & even iOS Catalina) but I started to get along with it. The software was fine. Now, suddenly without me doing anything to introduce malware to my computer, I think Apple did so purposefully (since it is all digital and accessible by WiFi) just so they could spy to see what else they can force-sell to me. It is sickening. My computer will not react normally anymore. It has become slower than a turtle, and I swear I did not download anything malicious. I even turn off the WiFi whenever I am not on. Sometimes, the darn WiFi will turn itself back on right in front of my eyes. I am not kidding, nor have I lost my marbles. I am a straight shooter & clear-headed.

After multiple visits to the Apple Store, they replaced it for me for free; which made me happy because there was something wrong with it. With the iPhone 5, it was really good except the battery would drain almost completely after a few hours. With the iPhone 5, they would not cover it under the Manufacture's Warranty and said that the battery was fine when it clearly wasn't. Fast forward many years later, iPhone Xr is very good, fast, battery lasts for days. Point is, my experience with Apple is good when the product is good. When the product doesn't work, I am really upset. It's good when they try to resolve the issue. I do recommend the MacBooks though. My MacBook is almost 10 years old and it's still running really well. In case anyone's wondering, I never buy AppleCare, I just buy a really good case for the product so that the screen doesn't shatter if I drop it. Customer service at Apple is hit and miss. I know Apple likes to empower the customers by teaching them to troubleshoot instead of troubleshooting it themselves; I have mixed feelings about that because it can come off a bit lazy from the customer's perspective and it's not good for customers that aren't technologically savvy. I do think Apple is overpriced. I only purchased a new iPhone after using the previous one for many many years and there's too much glitches/issues with the product at that point.\", 'UNBELIEVABLE NEW IPHONE WITHOUT PLUG.I have just bought the new iPhone pro Max 250 GB. I did not know that it comes with a charger cable but not with the plug. WHAT ??? you spend 1,200 pounds to find out that you need to buy the plug to charge your mobile. HOW CHEAP IS THIS?? Yes, I know that Apple sucks you dry, but like this? I regret buying Apple, I should have stuck with Android. ABORT ABORT', 'The pro max 11 is a bad phone. It over heats, websites always crash, I have to keep restarting my phone as I can‚Äôt view some videos. I‚Äôve also had videos edited. Apple hijack my phone.

I have to keep unplugging it and plugging back in beforeit starts to charge. It's a brand new laptop and charger so I'm confused why this happens.\", \"Apple need to review their repair processes.The problem is not with the people but with the system. We have purchased a high spec MacBook Pro which unfortunately we have experienced multiple problems with within the first 6 months. (we also have a 7 year old MacBook Pro which we have had no problems with).Upon calling Apple our options were to return the machine and wait for up to two weeks to find out if it is repairable or to be replaced. Genius bookings are not available (which granted is not apples fault due to COVID)For us being without the machine is not an option which we of course explained to the help centre.With the prices apple charge and the whole foundation of the brand being built on the user experience there's a few options you would have hoped were suggested:- An express repair service - repaired or replaced within a few days (when you pay over ¬£2k for a laptop I don't think this is a big ask)- A courtesy machine (again I don't think a huge ask for apple to offer a courtesy machine as an option if people are going to be without their machine for up to two weeks through no fault of their own)- A replacement machine (as we have had to have 4 calls with you now for the machine that is less than 6 months old we're happy to replace it)These are just three options that could have been suggested... but none were offered. Even when we enquired about each we were told 'it's just not what we do'.We outlined that we were being told our only option was to continue to work off the faulty laptop and wait until shops were re-opened as we cannot be without the machine to which the response was 'when you put it like that, yes'This is a simple process that Apple needs to review... a little bit of effort goes a long way. Even the express turnaround option (which isn't the best) is still something that would have made us feel a little more valued and less likely to write a bad review.I'd like to stipulate that the customer service personnel were very professional and friendly, they just either have poor training on what options are available OR Apple just have terrible options available (I have a feeling it's the latter)I'm not writing this to give Apple a bad name, we're Apple product fans through and through. I'm writing in the hope that Apple read this and adapt to it. You can never please everyone, especially when you're the size of Apple but you can certainly do a better job and give your customer service teams something better to work with - I feel sorry for them.\", \"I don't understand why there are so so many bugs in Apple software? From Safari to notes - it's just not working, losing information, bugs on sync, etc. They have this eco system, insanely high entry requirements for developers, charge a lot of money for their products, and yet have so many bugs...\", \"Terrible online Shop!

Can‚Äôt you at least make a bigger screen MacBook (not pro) for those of us that don‚Äôt need such high specs but need the screen size?

It still works perfectly, just a weakness regarding the battery but this is completely normal. I have also owned several iPhones. I have always loved Apple products.

I recently broke my iPhone 7 for good, and couldn't afford a new iPhone, so had to get a sh**ty Android.. well, how I miss my iPhone. Their customer service is also exceptional - better than any other company I've ever experienced, in fact! They are very caring, make it personal, stick with you until your problem has been resolved, and they're always extremely patient - never getting frustrated, just super friendly people. Cannot rate that highly enough; I LOVE their customer service!What I hate, however, is the fact the price of their products have sky-rocketed.. meaning I can now no longer justify buying them. Boo.\", \"Good products and whilst AppleCare and products can be expensive, it's no secret. customer service can be frustrating and slow which is my qualm\", \"Disappointed with Apple service lately. I have just been on the phone for nearly an hour with a mouse issue and hadn't even got past the clueless first 'advisor'. I seem to remember getting through to actual experts? The nail in the coffin was when she called back (after I had told her I couldn't spend any more time on this issue today and said goodbye) and told me the call was being recorded, whereupon I told her I would record it too and she said that wasn't allowed. You what now?\", 'very unhappy with my phone as had no charger and not given one separatecustomer service was good but still disappointed', \"Last week I had to bring my Macbook Air in for repair, as the battery started playing up. I was able to make an appointment with a Genius bar over the phone (lady on the phone was helpful, hence the 1st star). When I got to the Apple store in London it was chaotic. It looked like there were 3 different queues going on, clearly people all desperate to get their devices fixed before the second lockdown. Not surprisingly, I queued up for a good 30 minutes. When I finally got in, the 'Genius' told me the battery had failed ''cause I leave it plugged in when it's not being used''. That was the only advice I got. I said I hardly do, but according to him that was it. The Macbook is just over 2 years old, with a cycle count at 46...? And the battery fails and it's my fault..? I was trying to ask about consumer law as well but apparently batteries never fall under that.. So I had to fork out ¬£129 to replace the battery. The only good thing was that they had it replaced within a few hours, hence the second star. Other than that, the 'Genius' guy offered hardly any advice, I felt like I wasn't really listened to and having been out of a job for nearly 6 months I really could have done with a bit more help, especially bearing in mind they make MILLIONS. Disappointing customer service for such a recognised brand. I have always had Windows laptops before and never had any issues! The first time I bought a Mac may well be my last.\", 'Update: I was having issues with my MacBook Pro updating. I finally got it updated, but Apple support was no help at all. I‚Äôve also been having other issues. Apple has an issue right now where all of my devices keep having memory usage being filled in what they call the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù category. It‚Äôs to the point that I can‚Äôt update my devices because the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù category is using up almost all of the memory on my devices. Even if I delete all apps, photos, files, etc. On my devices there is still not enough storage. I‚Äôve chatted with Apple support a number of times and the ONLY way to fix they can give me is to do a full restart wiping ALL memory. Which is VERY frustrating and time consuming. I just have to keep using my Apple devices watching the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù category slowly taking up more and more memory until I need to do another restart wiping all of the memory from my devices and then set up the device again starting the whole process over. Apple has NO fix for this and the feeling I get is that this is planned obsolescence by Apple so customers will see their devices with no memory and many customers will find it easier to just buy the latest devices rather than spend time wiping the memory and restarting the device from scratch. I‚Äôm sure this is great for more business in the short term to get people buying new devices, but I no longer recommend Apple to others like I used to. I‚Äôm on the search for better devices.Original Review: Apple used to have good customer service. I‚Äôm not sure what happened, but now it takes forever to schedule an appointment at an Apple store. Then you still need to wait for help even with an appointment. Then the ‚ÄúGeniuses‚Äù at the Apple store seem to be mildly trained employees that take forever to figure out what the issue is. Today (11/12/20) my Mac won‚Äôt update, and Apple removed the chat option from customer service on their website, so if I want to get help, then they make you call them and wait on hold until someone is available to pick up the call. This is SO disappointing. They don‚Äôt even have an option to leave your phone number to call you when they‚Äôre ready, so you don‚Äôt need to wait on your phone for hours.', \"I've always had Apple iphones, what I don't like is that when you want the latest phone you've got to wait until your contract has ended.

I was not promoted to enter a shipping or billing addressing when using this service. When logging in to check on the status of the delivery I noticed it was shipped (and billed) to the incorrect address. I waited over an hour to talk to a representative from Apple who told me there was nothing she could do to help address the situation and it was my fault. She suggested I call the USPS.I again waited for over an hour with USPS who suggested I would place a parcel intercept form, at $15 each, but found out the items were already delivered to the incorrect address and hopefully would be ‚Äúreturned to sender‚Äù.

She said that the apple watch may do the things I wanted. What cutting edge, out of the box, innovative features did I hope to have?1. A screen large enough so that I don't have to hold the device to my face to see the tiny letters; and large enough that I don't have to have a finger the size of a pencil to press tiny buttons on the screen.2. I wanted to be able to play music from the watch. NOT to have the watch just act as a middle-man between my smartphone music app. That's just stupid. Let me repeat, having a smart watch that just plays music via bluetooth from the smartphone then to headphones is something concocted by a special kind of stupid human. I want to have the music downloaded ON the smartwatch and played via bluetooth to headphones. You know, like how some MP3 players worked 10 years ago. So.... actually not original or innovative at all.3. I want a stopwatch. One that has a timer countdown before an auto-start. You know, like how many quality watches that costs about $100 or above can offer. But with a smartwatch, I need only tap on the screen to start, and tap again to stop. Because, and I know this sounds crazy and requires totally out of the box thinking, after running really fast, or performing an exhausting exercise that you're trying to time, it's infuriatingly annoying to have to find and press a button to stop the timer. Especially when your drenched in sweat and sweat is running in your eyes. Just tap the screen to turn on the auto-timer...wait for the beep countdown, and start training. As soon as you're done, tap the screen again. I KNOW, I KNOW, This kind of innovative, genius thinking is beyond the high-paid designers at Apple.4. I know FOUR things. But this is the last one. Ready? This will blow your mind. I would like a watch (especially one that costs nearly half a grand) to display my heart rate at all times. Have it in a corner of the screen. Because, and I know this is expecting far too much, but while I'm physically exerting myself doing interval training, I would like to simply look at my watch and get my heart rate. I don't want to have to press a button on the screen. Wait for the results and wait to see the data. I don't want to carry Apple's brick of a smartphone that I must also wrap with a large protective covering, because iPhones are fragile as overpriced fine china.Well, I got this iWatch piece of garbage. Charged it. Set it up. I downloaded Spotify (because I stopped using Apple's terrible music service a lone time ago). Oh, one can see a parallel between Apple's worsening quality of products, lack of innovation, and idiotic ideas with the slow demise of what was once a great music platform: iTunes.Apple failed to deliver yet again. I couldn't do not a single thing I mentioned above. A $500 watch failed to do any of the things I listed because of lazy design, needless app restrictions, or design flaws.\", 'I purchased a ipad mini 4, 18 months ago from Argos. During lock down  i Face timed my daughter, then left it on table untill the evening when i went to use it again it was  completely dead. would not charge. i contacted a company near me . apple repair company. they have justed opened this week.

Where Apple excels is the integration and how Apple devices seamlessly communicate in between.  Apple has fantastic stores with lovely staff working there and easily accessible support. Now, that support is not as bad as Google and Samsung, but simply can't help in anything Apple ID-related - they say ‚Äùwe can't do anything, we left all the power to the user‚Äù and, well, I can't do anything - all my changes (misspelt email) are permanent. They don't allow me to do anything about it, and they refuse to do anything. At least they're polite while not helping.\", 'I thought it important to write about the Apple IPAD PRO which I bought 6 months ago - it is not ideal for doing work (ie writing documents or doing anything detailed in perhaps excel or google docs etc), as It‚Äôs very skittish, it can easily tap on another area of the screen with or without your pen, and with or without you noticing, then you lose your train of thought as to what you were trying to do as you have to backtrack and amend so many typos....  so if you need to work on important detailed documents with lots of information, unless you are always on the move I would just buy a laptop, which is what I‚Äôm going to have to do now. The iPad Pro in my view is only good for image related stuff eg Pinterest, making hand written notes or drawing on Adobe Fresco (which is amazing technology).', 'I have long been a Customer of Apple and the ITunes Store but am increasingly frustrated that they remove items and then say to customers ‚Äúit‚Äôs been withdrawn by the supplier, if you haven‚Äôt saved it on an external hard drive, hard luck‚Äù.

It worked well the first year, but after that is has been nothing but trouble. Been to the service center many times. Had my Apple Smart Keyboard replaced, but the screen becomes unresponsive more and more, for several seconds and at completely random times. On the internet, it is a known problem.Also on my MacBook Pro I suffer from serious software problems. The days are gone that I could recommend Apple products. IF and only IF they work as they should, they are great.Changed from 1 star to 2 stars, since the software problems on my Macbook appear to be solved by updates and my MacBook Pro is now working great.Somewhat reluctantly changing the review from 2 stars to 3 stars. Bought an LG 5k Ultrafine USB-C monitor which arrived with a nonfunctioning camera in the monitor. Have been on the phone with AppleCare for hours trying to see if there was a software problem, but couldn't find anything. Then returned the monitor to Amac and received a new one the next day with working camera. The monitor in combination with my Macbook is simply superb: one USB-C cable for powering my Mac, for the video signal to the monitor, for the microphone and the camera. Well done Apple!

I saw a review that said it was to make it more user friendly. How exactly? By making everyone that buys a phone have to buy Bluetooth? or making them use earpods that have can only be used when not charging? the earpods make my ears hurt so i thought OK ill buy an adaptor and use my old earphones but has anyone seen the reviews of the official apple adaptors? i would have thought that by now someone at apple would have gone \"hmm maybe we should make this product better so that people want to buy them.

If people are spending that much why not give them airpods with the phone? or even the adaptor for the jack?(although the adaptor is trash). All you get in the box for an xr is the charger, the phone, the earpods and some paper.

Apple should take step to shut those unauthorised showrooms.', 'Over the past 6 years, My wife and I were big Apple fans and have purchased Apple iPhone 5s, iPhone 6s, and iPhone X along with other Apple computing and entertainment products for the home and personal lifestyle. Out of the 10 Apple products we have purchased over the past 6 years, three devices became non functional requiring replacement or repairs.  All three devices became corrupt and just stopped working (not due to damage) after the warranty period requiring expensive repairs.  Our oldest Apple laptop (one of the first models released) is still working with no issues other than being a dinosaur. Thirty percent of our Apple products failed over 6 years.  We have other \"Non Apple\" branded computers/gaming consoles/cameras/cell phones dated back to early 2000\\'s which are still working when turned on with no problems (just outdated).  I\\'ve never had as many failure problems with other electronic brands until we started buying Apple products.  We thought we just we were having bad Apple luck. Seems the newer Apple products are attractive in design with interesting/competitive features to draw customers in and compete with other brands, however not designed as durable as older products or some competitors.   My opinion is that Apple has changed the strategy of building quality and durable products in the past that were very reliable to a current eye catching attractive products with a lot of want to be cool features that looks upscale with a high $$$.$$ price tag but, lacking in quality and durability with glitches/problems from trying to push a new product out every year.   The final straw which made me decide to steer away from Apple was the fact that Apple has pulled some sneaky moves on products in the recent past to include poor quality glass on iPhone screens, battery issues that were well known about, as recently has removed the iPhone X from their website to the point I couldn\\'t find a manual for my iPhone X that I just purchased in July 2018 or find support titles for my phone.   Hmmm....... Call me crazy but, what\\'s up with that?  Why are we hiding support documents and info for the Anniversary iPhone X?   Probably should verify my Apple Care Plus is still activated and showing on my account too?It\\'s obvious Apple\\'s current strategy in the business is to attract as many new customers as possible and make a huge profit as quickly as possible with as many products as possible (rightfully so) however, not at the expense of quality, reliability, and honesty which in turn pushes the loyal customer towards other brands as you can see.    Selling the new iPhone XS for $999 in 2018 versus 2017 iPhone X model for $999 is awesome for customers who waited a year later to see what Apple has been working on and what they were going to reveal.   A year later for same price, you get basically the same iPhone X with some enhancements and the nearly a year old iPhone X gets completely removed from the website?  IF THAT DOESN\\'T SEND CUSTOMERS A MESSAGE, FOLKS NEED TO WAKE UP\".   Apple wonders what\\'s going on with their sales?  Read what I just wrote, put yourself in the customers shoes, and ask yourself if you would want to buy an Apple iPhone or Apple product from this experience.   Folks are on to the Apple trends and will not buy Apple products until they see enough reviews online to prove it\\'s worth the steep purchase now or wait another year.  Apple is turning into a business like a cable company.  All about getting the new customer but after the first year, hard to keep a customer loyal.  It does leave a bad taste in my mouth though with the way they just removed iPhone X like it never existed and still have older phones prior to iPhone X still listed on their website.  I think the iPhone X was and is my last Apple product purchase.   My wife feels the same way.Apple, not sure if you are listening or reading but, my recommendation would be to \"SLOW DOWN\", focus on quality solid products and don\\'t worry about what new cool product needs to be ready for manufacturing in January 2019 after September 2018 release of current products (4 months later).  Why not operate like Honda and Toyota, don\\'t forget about the loyal fans and customers who currently have last years products, let the product be used, get feedback, focus on fixes, then when it\\'s time to release the next fancy product, it will be shocking to everyone.  It would be nice to see Apple to work out a plan and come out with a fix to some issues with the product you just released last year.  Fix the glitchy iPhone X Face ID for last years customers.  Don\\'t leave them to sit and watch a better product for the same price come out with no hope for a fix to last years model, just delete it so we don\\'t have to deal with it.  it\\'s just wrong and makes a bold statement that you have no time for last years stuff, focus is currently on whats now in production.  Seems like you\\'re missing a team of engineers to focus on ongoing known issues. We wish Apple the best but, I think we are tired of these trends.  Apple is not what it was years ago and it shows.   The new releases every September are no longer interesting.  It leaves me with negative thoughts from past experiences and we just want to look the other way.Sorry so negative but, we speak from the heart and the truth.Sincerely,', 'While I enjoy the products, the service aspect is lacking at best.

I Ordered a MacBook Pro recently with the educational promotion through Apple for school this semester. The system processed half of my order and not the other so I wasn't going to receive my product. I went through hours of customer service calls (which were a nightmare). They would put me on hold for 20+ minutes at a time and still not answer any of my questions. I was then passed around to many different people, none of which could help me fix the problem. They would try to send me back to previous people I had spoken with and then provide me with invalid extensions just to get me off the line. Even a week after my refund and product cancelation from the system, they still couldn't figure out how to let me order my MacBook. When I finally got it ordered under someone else's Apple ID, I paid more for the express shipping so that I would get in within the next couple of days for school and they didn't even respect that request. They didn't ship my order until after the date I originally paid for it to arrive at my house. I then had to go through more calls, transfers and holds to get a refund on the extra I paid for my shipping. I had originally attempted to purchase my MacBook a couple of weeks before school started but did not end up receiving it until a couple weeks into the semester. Completely ridiculous.

Apple was carrying the Job\\'s service values into the market, backing them up with faultless customer support and offering a genuinely alternative consumer experience.Now, sadly, those values have been lost in Apple\\'s relentless drive for increased commercial expansion and profiteering. The technical consistency that was a hallmark of Apple products has gone - my problems with my newish iMac provide a relevant example:     ‚Ä¢ About 2-3 years ago I updated my iMac just before going into hospital for several weeks. When I returned home I found my iMac overrun with \"duplicate files\". My documents folder had increased from 3gb to over 90gb, my contacts had suffered severe duplication along with several entries being completely deleted. My \"Pages\" library, containing my work-documents, was in a state of complete chaos with duplicated and missing documents. My iTunes library was also in a similar state of chaos. I rang Apple, expecting them to invite me to take my iMac to their store where, hopefully, they would sort it out. No invite was given and instead I was urged to sort it out myself with help from telephone support. So began a long series of phone calls with Apple support - I tried to keep my number of advisors to a minimum but this proved to be impossible. Involuntary \"File Duplication\" is a complex issue and very, very few Apple Support Advisors have the least idea of how to tackle it, instead they will lead you blindly through procedures that will leave you in a state of utter chaos and confusion. Apple telephone support works best with quick-fix problems that can be solved in 10 minutes or so, it DOES NOT WORK with extensive problems that require joined-up thinking over several weeks.If I were to invoice Apple at my professional rate for time spent on this issue (a procedure on which I am taking legal advice) they would find themselves looking at a invoice of several thousand pounds.

Black screen, no response, no power up - nothing.  Went to Apple store and updated to latest software, only for phone to repeatedly die, as witnessed by the receptionist person. Receptionist person said if it's a hardware fault we'll certainly replace the phone.  Still had to wait an hour for a 'Genius' to see me to confirm what receptionist had already seen - yes, software updated, yes, phone dies repeatedly with visible screen glitch.  Ran lots more tests to confirm, indeed it was more than a software issue but then refused to replace with new phone.  Insisted 'the process' was that I accept a iPhone 6 on loan for two weeks while they send off the malfunctioning phone. First loaner phone didn't even work, as I noticed before leaving with it. My pleas that any premium brand would normally offer a new replacement on the spot where it's self-evidently not fit for purpose fell on deaf ears.  All the genius could say, on repeat, was 'It's the process' and the even less helpful 'I know where you're coming from'. It would have been more honest to simply say 'Computer says No.' Hopelessly inadequate.  I can't think of any other expensive tech product where the manufacturer wouldn't be falling over themselves to apologise and instantly replace rather than increasing your frustration by giving you the liability of a loaner phone while they muse over what particular manufacturing or parts fault has led to an expensive but rubbish product. I have no idea how long they will take as they couldn't tell me. I only got this because of a manufacturing design error in the iPhone 6 Plus I had before which succumbed to 'Touch Disease' as written about on the internet and now the subject of class action lawsuits in the USA.

After screen sharing with them new issues arise and the old issue is still not fixed.  I have had support people who can not even understand the problem and have to ask others for advise while I am on hold.  The level of knowledge amongst support is very variable.  For what these devices cost I expect them to work and get seamless support.  I do not expect perfection, the devices are very complicated.  But it seems the right hand is not talking to the left.  And for 4 times what a similar laptop would cost I expect support.  Another issue is the absolute complexity of their web site support pages.  I have counted 5 ways to get in touch with support, and all have different web pages.  Their CHAT while using proper grammar and language gives really poor advice.  ALWAYS talk to a person.  ALWAYS.   Another thing to watch our for is when they update the OS.  Their eco-system is so compliocated and inter-connected it creates ripples throughout your entire computer.

I expected them to send me a new keyboard and I would send back the faulty one in the original box which I kept.He couldn't assure me that the Apple store in Brussels would exchange the product or would take it in for repair. I really can't imagine how a smart keyboard can be repaired. It would 'only take a couple of days'.

This would have been a great experience, except it wasn't. I first reported the problem to Apple well over a month ago after trying all the fixes I saw online. Boy was the internet full of stories just like mine.  I was told they couldn't help me until I gave them my serial number off the keyboard which was unreadable. I took a picture and sent it to Apple where they were able to read it. I was then told that if I give them my credit card info they would send me a box to return the keyboard, they would look at it and then decide whether to replace it for free or charge me for another one. I refused to give my credit card info. Please just send me a box and let me send you the keyboard. It took several chat's and phone calls this last month to finally get someone to send me a box. When they finally did I packed up the keyboard and sent it off. 4 days later it was back. When I opened the box I didn't know what to expect because there was no info from Apple. What did they do? Is it a new keyboard? No? Did you fix it? Looks like it. Now all is well.

The only thing offensive is the company\\'s attitude towards it\\'s customer base. Please allow me to explain.  We own many Apple iPhones and other products.  I visited the Evergreen Walk store in South Windsor Ct  on June 23rd to amongst other things, purchase an iPhone.  As we completed the very long and horribly tedious process of purchasing the phone using the 0% monthly payment plan, My 770 credit score was denied.  Yes that is right DENIED.  The \"process\"  includes recording your drivers license, your credit card for automatic charges to your account, and collection of your SS # and birthdate.  I work very hard to maintain excellent credit but 3 years ago I was sued for $274. for a medical bill I disputed. I lost (I could not make it to court that day) and paid the $274 to the undeserved medical company for a duplicate payment for a medical test.  ALL that information becomes a part of your credit history.  And yes my credit score is still 770, since it had occurred far enough in the past.  I even very recently refinanced my mortgage and took out a home equity Loan on my house without any problems.  Citizen One financial however does not review your credit, if you have an unsatisfactory score or in my case a \"judgement\" you are denied, period.  Neither company apparently has anyone smart enough to read a credit report.  Citizen One claims that the standards are put in place by Apple, not sure I believe them though.

Repair No: R234957421. A few days ago, when I dropped my new iPhone 6S the first time ever, its screen has shattered.After that, I place the iPhone inside the protective case, and a week later I took it to Apple Yorkdale for screen replacement.Inside the Apple Yorkdale store I stumbled across many poorly designed business practices and procedures which make Apple customers look stupid and guilty when actually they are not.LIST OF EVENTS:1.The black guy who accepted my phone for repair, take a close look at my iPhone, but did not draw my attention to any scratches, and even did not mention about them at all! He just asked to read a half page of text and put signature on a touchscreen. Me, as many of you, made a mistake by not reading the text carefully, thinking that it was a standard legal bla-bla-bla and I just signed it.2. When I received my phone from repair, I noticed the scratch in the LOWER RIGHT corner and reported it to the dark beard guy who was releasing my iPhone after screen replacement. I expected that Apple will replace the scratched part, and that‚Äôs it. The guy printed out the Genius Bar Work Authorization form, which to my great surprise in the ‚ÄúProblem Description/Diagnosis‚Äù section stated (quote): ‚ÄúIssue: Custormer reportsPhone fell and glass crackedSteps to Reproduce: Visual verificationMRI. ‚Äì passCosmetic condition: Display cracked ‚Äìimpact point TOP LEFTLight surface scratchesEmployee 1130550164‚ÄùI did not remember any scratches in the LOWER RIGHT corner, and I firmly believed at that time that there was none when I passed my phone for repair. I asked the dark beard guy to contact the black guy who took my phone and confirm with him that there was no mentioning of any scratches before repair. He answered that that black guy had already left and cannot be reached. I am not that stupid, and I am sure that this standard ‚ÄúLight surface scratches‚Äù phrase is either automatically inserted by the Apple software, or routinely inserted by Apple employees who take iPhones in for repair, as insurance from customer complaints about pre-existing scratches. I understand their point, but it makes all customers automatically guilty when accidental scratch is made by Apple employees. Just do not tell me that it never happens \\uf04aHere are the flaws in Apple business procedures when my iPhone was taking in for repair (and I suspect they are systemic flaws for Apple as a whole):-Apple employee did not draw my attention to pre-existing scratches;-Apple employee did not take pictures of the iPhone‚Äôs back and sides which would allow Apple to prove its position if a complaint is made; 3. I asked to speak with somebody from the Apple store management team. Some grey beard guy came to me. His body language was explicitly saying: ‚ÄúDude, stop wasting my time!‚Äù Again, he referred to the ‚ÄúLight surface scratches‚Äù and said that he cannot help me with my complaint.Finally, I was asked to sign a two page long legal disclaimer, which I have read carefully this time, and I made a handwritten note above my signature about the newly discovered scratch.Here are the flaws in Apple business procedures when my iPhone was release after the repair (and I suspect they are systemic flaws in Apple as a whole):-The employee who was taking phone in for repair cannot be reached;-The touchpad for customer‚Äôs signatures is oversensitive, and it took me SEVERAL attempts to right my comment above the signature because several times I accidentally pressed the ‚ÄúClear‚Äù link on the screen;-The employees who participated in the conflict resolution discussion did not introduce themselves, and I am almost sure they are not added their notes and employee numbers to the Genius Bar Work Authorization form as a conflict resolution participants.I hope, that somebody from Apple will read this feedback, and pass the flaws to the upper management for review.Overall, this visit to Apple Store changed my impression about Apple to worse, and their employees do not look trustworthy any longer for me.I hope that my complaint will make potential customers think twice before purchasing from Apple!-----------MY ADVICE TO APPLE CUSTOMERS: Take in the Apple store another camera, and make pictures in presence of Apple employee before passing them your Apple product for repair!', 'Date of experience: May 08, 2017', \"Have had my iPad Air 2 for a while now and really anticipate the Air 3 but the guys down in my local Apple depot in the city creek centre don't have dates for it yet.

So we waited about 15 minutes and a woman staffer comes up to address our questions -- then this clapping and cheering breaks out. The staffer asks us to wait until the commotion settles down before proceeding, but it went on and on and on... turns out another staffer was leaving after his final shift and this was the way employees are sent off. This was extremely annoying because he stopped to hug every employee with brief conversations. This continued --while we THE CUSTOMERS -- waited because our staffer had joined in the cheering and clapping for the duration of this activity. Ok -- I get the team connection, but Apple, there would be no team if not for the consumer. By the time this episode wrapped up I was ready to leave and make no purchase but we stuck it out to get our questions answered. And frankly the staffer was not very knowledgeable.

If a third party product & it goes wrong they immediately go into deflect & total non-responsibility mode. Under British Law they must replace a product with 30 days.

Yes, I tried pushing the home button and the on/off button for 10 seconds...I got the apple logo, then it died again. I tried holding them for 45 seconds while plugged into iTunes and got the update/restore screen. Unfortunately, the phone would not update or restore properly. I tried the online Apple support and got no help other than mentioning the things I had already tried. His solution was to try a different computer. Eventually the phone actually did go through a total restore and then update from my last back up using the computer I had been on all along. I was frustrated to have spent 6 hours messing with it, but relieved to have my phone back. I went to bed more happy than not. In the morning, I overslept because the phone had died again while plugged in. We were back to square one...black screen, apple logo fading away...ready to cry or scream or both, I made a Genius Bar appointment at the location 45 minutes from home. I know I am lucky to have one that close, but it is still quite a drive when coupled with the two and a half hours spent in the store. The technician was ok. She did what she could but couldn\\'t fix the phone. She eventually said I would get a new phone, but then said oh no, wait you only get a loaner. We have to send this one in to be repaired.

Consequently I contacted Apple a number of times, both in stores and at the support phone centre for help and advice.So far the advice has consisted of;Reboot it (duh - think I haven't already tried that a million times?!)Erase and restore itRestore it as a new device rather than from a backup The various people I've spoken with have run their diagnostics and reported that there are no errors and the battery appears to be fine (although my experience shows it's far from fine), and so as they can't diagnose a fault they won't repair or replace.Finally this week, after months of battling with the issue Apple have announced that they're aware of a Shutdown Flaw affecting some iPhone 6S devices which has exactly the symptoms I'm experiencing, and so I gleefully called the support team, as I can finally get some support on the issue.  The support guy I spoke with was actually very good and checked my serial number and confirmed that mine was in the batch which has the fault, but really all he could do was book an appointment with a Genius bar as the device would need to be repaired or replaced.  I confirmed I wished to have it replaced as the overheating battery may have affected other components, and realistically I have that option under the UK's Consumer Rights Act.  Unfortunately there were only 3 slots open in the London Covent Garden store, a week away.  As I really wanted this resolved sooner the advisor suggested I drop in to an Apple store and speak to a manager, as it was a relatively easy resolution; simply swap the device for a new one - Apple already know it has a manufacturing fault so no diagnostics are needed.As advised, I dropped into the London Regent Street branch (slightly easier to get to for me than Covent Garden) and asked for a manager, and was directed to a Mr Sharma. The 'manager' seemed to have difficulty understanding the story and was intent on making me a Genius bar appointment, for which he had a 5-6 hour waiting list.  I tried to explain that I didn't need any technical help, I just needed a replacement, but he wasn't listening.  He was rude and dismissive, and when I told him that I didn't want to wait for 5 hours he told me to leave the store as I didn't have any business being there if I didn't want to have technical help or buy a product!As I'd been unsuccessful at Regent Street I proceeded straight over to Covent Garden and again asked for a manager, adding some background for him and my thoughts about how Apple support was worsening - he didn't like that I wasn't happy with the service, but instead of sympathising and trying to recover the situation he seemed to become aggravated - not a great way for a 'manager' to deal with a consumer.  He did, however, get me to a Genius bar technician about an hour later.When I finally sat down with the Genius bar technician he didn't perform any diagnosis, he simply booked it for a replacement (which could have been done on the phone, or by any of the members of Apple staff I'd spoken to already), however as it's their standard policy booked it for a recycled device, despite my understanding that I would receive another new device to replace my faulty one.  As they don't hold stock I have to return in 3-5 days to swap it over.After leaving the store I checked with Which's legal team and they confirmed that under the Consumer Rights Act I do have the right to demand a brand new device, as that's what I purchased, and so I called the support team again.  After spending 40 minutes on the phone with them the senior advisor finally worked out that I'd need to speak to Covent Garden again about ensuring the replacement was for new and not recycled and transferred me to the branch.  A woman answered, said 'hello? hello?' and then hung up.I'm on to the support team again, this time I'm 24 minutes in and still nowhere.Not sure what I have to do to get Apple to resolve this.  Right now I'd settle for them even fulfilling their legal obligations.After decades of using Apple and tens of thousands of pounds of expenditure I'm about ready to stop using Apple entirely.  Great hardware but atrocious customer service when things go wrong.  It's hardly 'it just works', it's more 'when it doesn't work it's a nightmare'.\", 'I\\'m done. 5 iPhones and two iPads later I\\'m done. The deceptive trade practices in the form of \"updates\" is finally enough. Being a huge fan and supporter of apple products has become increasingly difficult. I\\'m tired of my technology investments becoming gradually slower and bug riddled by updates. It is my opinion there are two primary reasons for the constant updates. One is spying via data mining and the other is the gradual pursuit of eventually outdating products via updates. So I\\'ll purchase a dumb phone next time I need one and no more purchases through the Apple Store. Apple, you have officially been boycotted from this point forward. I\\'m sick of the constant pop up screens informing me I need to update. So please \"update\" your customer list and remove one person.

I try to be fair, but I\\'m also just. I understand Steve Jobs isn\\'t here and won\\'t be coming back (rest his soul), but Apple must chill. EVERY time you turn around there\\'s a \"new\" iPhone. Where? Where is the new iPhone, Apple? You adjust the camera, maybe add some pigmentation to the backlight, or there\\'s some promise of \\'improvement\\' in the system altogether. How is that new? How IPHONE, how!? You overprice your items and you over produce a name that stands as a great functioning system without you guys always tinkering away on something I find to be useless. Another \"home\" app that\\'s unnecessary or an IOS update that\\'s always CHANGING everything. You take away small, but useful tweaks and auction it off as a \"step up\" when all it does is irritate me. LEAVE THE PHONE ALONE, and focus on things that matter, like actually making the Alarm work. Can we start there? Or adding personalization that isn\\'t so constricting and BORING. Yes, this review was written with anger, but again, we\\'re drawn back to my statement about fairness, but to be \"just\" as well. I try to give the new updates a chance, for one, they\\'re too frequent to ignore and one (myself) starts to see a decline in performance to where I\\'m forced to upgrade, and for two, I\\'m hoping that Apple will fix their gaps in their operating system. Each time, I\\'m disappointed and I\\'ve been with Apple for years. Loyalty keeps me here as opposed to switching to Android, but I\\'ve thought on many occasions to just doing it anyways and saving myself the headache of another \"iPhone release\". I understanding having to keep up with demands of a fast paced market, but it gets to a point where you guys start to overlook the needs of the customers to fill your own pockets...and call it capitalism all you want, but it\\'s the consumer that keeps the company at bay. The IPhone 7 is a joke and I have an IPhone 6. I haven\\'t even had this iPhone long enough to be comfortable, let alone think about an upgrade. The replacement of the headphone jack was ridiculous and all part of some ploy to give the phone something \"new\", but again \"unnecessary\". Marketing Apple Wireless EarPods? Really? What if they fall out? Is there a tracking system? Or perhaps an automatic refund when they\\'re lost in the shuffle of life? I doubt it, Apple, I doubt it. Have several seats and just enjoy being a great company that honestly does make great products.

But, lately, Apple products seem needlessly overloaded with too many bells and whistles that I suspect 99 % of their customers don't really use, and they aren't nearly as intuitive as they once were.  And, they have become seriously expensive.  I wouldn't mind the expense so much if they still delivered top line customer service, but this experience is causing me to consider returning to PC's.

Apple was always something intriguing to me that I wanted to learn more about as I grew up with all Microsoft products. Within the past year I got a MacBook Pro, an Air 2, and have been contemplating the IPhone 6S. I had one rough patch when Apple Care would not repair the MacBook that my son literally sprinkled his sippy cup over when I had by far worse accidents repaired by Geek Squad at Best Buy with no issues. Long story short, we ended up working out a compromise, despite the surprise with their lesser coverage in comparison. When it came to Apple, I had superior expectations with everything do to so many positive reviews from products and customer support. Also, with the price point to what most would consider a premium quality product.\\rTonight really took the cake. I had an absolutely DISGRACEFUL experience with the closing manager at the South Windsor Connecticut store. \\rLet me start with the fact that I have been working in retail for at least past decade of my life now and I know that more and more of large scale corporations are leaning towards online sales. This is out of \"convenience\" to the customer (or in my opinion a way of hiring less store employees across the board in a company), companies have set their sales up so that a customer can purchase an item for a quick pick up that very same day at a nearby location. Again, this is supposed to be a \"convenience\" to the customer.\\rSo, tonight I did just that and purchased a typical IPad Mini that most all Apple locations readily have on hand. On the order it said \"Pick up: Available Today\". It did also state that there would be a confirmation email when the order was ready to be picked up. I did not have time to wait as I only had the free time to pick it up before the store closed so I headed in that direction thinking logically as most would that how much time do they need to get a stock item on their shelf \"ready\". Heck, I don\\'t mind waiting a few minutes for them to prepare things if need be.\\rI headed in and they greeted me after a few moments and I told them that I was ready to pick up my item. They started to look it up, but couldn\\'t find anything which made me concerned as I process credit and loans in my retail position all the time. So, I understand the speed in which transactions process electronically and had the expectation of Apple being an efficient company.\\rThe young lady who helped me, called Apple Online Customer Service to question it further. During the end of that call, so she proceeded to tell me that the order was placed on a 24 hour hold for fraud which was even more upsetting. I glanced at my email on my phone to see that the order had processed on my credit card . She then advised me to call Apple Online Store back to speak with verification (rather than connecting me herself to someone). \\rI called them back myself to get a woman who told me that it takes 24 hours to process the sale and there was nothing they could do other than have me drive back tomorrow (which was a time that I was not available after already driving an hour round trip to/from that location), but that there was no holds or fraud notifications on the order. She suggested that I spoke to a verification specialist about the fraud and then transferred to me to a menu that kept asking me to punch in an extension which further frustrated me.\\rI then asked the young lady in the store if I could speak with a manager who could help clear things up as I had come so far. So, this older man who was the manager that evening immediately confronted me after speaking with her. He aggressively asked if I had received the email that it was ready for pick up. I said no, but it said ready today and I did not have the time to wait before closing. He cut me off and argued that I was wrong for even bothering to come in for that item without any confirmation of it being ready. At the point I purchase that item, it is MINE. I should not have to be told when I can have it when I am a paying customer. That 24 hour hold is a CROCK if I ever did hear one. I sell orders for thousands of dollars in my retail position via online for immediate pick up in store. My order was a measly three hundred something dollars which any fraud department would have squared away in no time. I said maybe I should of bought it from Best Buy and they would let me pick it right up. He encouraged me to go ahead!! He continued to argue with why I was wrong (something that you should NEVER do in retail with your customer). He then just turned his back to me and walked off as I called my friend asking what I should do as I was extremely upset and on the verge of canceling it. If it wasn\\'t for the fact that I am leaving the state before this weekend and this wasn\\'t a gift for my friend who wanted this particular device badly, I surely would have!\\rThis has been one hell of a first year dealing with Apple and I am completely turned off.', \"Got the new iphone 6 but no headphones? the package was empty? blooming heck apple!

I had been an iPhone enthusiast for some years. In November, after downloading the new Yosemite operating system, my Macbook would only reboot about a third of the way. Since I had purchased AppleCare, I called for help (waited 50 mins to speak to the person that could help at all) I was directed to a Senior Associate who was very helpful. These were the steps: (1) put in a order for an engineer to recommend a solution and his answer would take 4 days (2) then the Associate called and informed me on what to do and the computer had to set for the rest of the day to finish the first process (3) next day- more steps (4) purchased a 100.00 external hard drive--finally a working computer after 7-8 days.

Associate: You are gonna have to take your Macbook over to MacAuthority or somewhere and have your data backed up (which you will have to pay for) and then bring it back here after that and we will clear your computer and reinstall our software.\\rMe: Could I possibly loose some of my data? for instance, I probably have 3-4000$ worth of Nursing Textbooks and several research papers just to name a few things.\\rAssociate: We don\\'t deal with your data, that will be your responsibility--Apple is only responsible for putting our software back on there.\\rMe: (in my ignorance) So if iCloud doesn\\'t back up my data what is it for?\\rAssociate: its only our responsibility to make sure the software is on there and your responsible for your data.\\rIn conclusion, I wanted to post this article to let those of you that are considering an Apple product to realize a few facts:\\r1. if you download a new operating system or an update by Apple and it screws up your computer-[to my surprise]-all Apple can offer you is to clear your computer, reinstate their software (after you have paid to have your data backed-up) and your left with possible loss of data that they don\\'t deal with.\\r2. AppleCare only covers the hardware of the computer and allows you to call and get help if you don\\'t understand something-\\r{I know Apple is having major software issues, because I previously have called in the past and spoken to someone in about 5-10 mins max--now when you call its 45-60 mins to get to a human}--I should have taken the customer service guy\\'s advice that told me that if it was him he wouldn\\'t download the Yosemite until all the bugs were worked out of it.\\r3. Just because Apple was once an awesome company does not mean they are concerned about the same things that are important to you--just go online and try to find a number that you can talk to someone in their complaint department....let me know if you find such a number. Also, don\\'t think that Apple will make sure you always have a working computer whether you have AppleCare or not.

So if you have the insurance with Apple care my sure your Find my app is turned on.  My brother and I will not use the insurance app with our phone carrier instead from now on.  Just FYI\", \"Both some of the best, and worst, mobile phones.Apple makes some of the most powerful mobile phones thanks to their EXCELLENT silicon engineers, but then they ruin them by loading them with a heavily locked down os, terrible batteries, and make them irritating to take apart to service.Their lithium batteries SUCK! They wear out after three days and afterwards need to be recharged after 17 femtoseconds.(Im exaggerating of course, but you get the idea.)The iphone 10 is genuinely one of the BEST mobile phones I've ever used, but I'm probably going to go with a generic low end rootable android phone next.\", 'I really like  Apple products but their cloud options are the worst. The subscription package goes 5GB-200GB-2TB there is nothing between 200GB and 2TB. These days 200GB is nothing if you have the latest iPhone but the price is ¬£9 a month. I wish they offered 1TB at more affordable price instead of locking customers in due to limited options', 'I am thrilled about using the iPhone 11! Its camera, messaging apps, photo editing tools, and other features have significantly simplified my daily life. It feels like I have a personal assistant who manages my entire routine. As a result, I am now planning to purchase a MacBook. Nevertheless, I am a bit confused by the wide range of models available. But I know that I will eventually select the right one for me.

If you can find Apple product at a discount they are closure to a good value. Last gen products and Apple refurbished products are also a good value. Third party Apple retailers generally offer better deals. Apple has really moved to a closed off ecosystem having all devices now use Apple chips. They also skew performance figures to make their chips look better. They are very good but nothing magical about Apples hardware other than Apples is more closed off and more difficult to compare to other hardware makers. You buy Apple products you buy into Apple and its ecosystem. A lot of times this is beneficial but it‚Äôs not without feeling some exclusiveness from the rest of the Windows and Android world. Connecting with other Apple users is straightforward but have friends with Windows PC or Android devices? Yeah not so much. Genius Bar help is hit or miss too, some are actually good and some clearly are not so well trained. Myself I don‚Äôt have a nearby Apple Store so I rely more on solving issues with community help and chat with Apple support. It‚Äôs ok but hardly what I would call super helpful basically going through what any support would do with redundant tests and basically resetting everything. Apple support seems coached to never admit a common issue many are having. It is what it is and you probably have better results talking to a Genius at a Apple Store.', 'Recently purchased the Apple Watch Ultra, and although it is definitely a step-up on the Series 7, the fitness tracking is still too unreliable.Despite doing a number of runs both outdoors and indoors, the watch is always way behind on tracked distance. As an example, I have just finished a 10km run on a treadmill, yet the watch has tracked it as 8.12km. Apple suggests running outdoors so that the watch can re-calibrate. Have done this a number of times and still no luck. A simple solution would be to give you the option to alter the tracked distance, much like other companies like Garmin allow. Really don‚Äôt understand why Apple have never released such a simple solution.If you‚Äôre after a fitness watch, I‚Äôd strongly recommend Polar or Garmin. If you‚Äôre after a smart watch only, then the Apple Watch Series 7/8 will do', 'The products are getting worse and worse, not like how they used to.

So wasted that time too.I want my time, energy and money back.Update:I went to the Apple Store with an appointment in Sydney CBD.

Apple used to make a lasting, quality product. My 5S was kicking for 5+ years. It was still working when I retired it for a 2020 SE after they started zapping battery life on old models (I don‚Äôt buy the explanation they fed us on that one by the way). Now they make them to last 2 years max. I hardly use my phone (texts and light browsing) and it just drains. If I‚Äôm sleeping and it‚Äôs unplugged, it can easily die on its own. Well, the old ‚Äúinferior‚Äù 5S battery didn‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs a shame their only goal is to sell as many devices as possible - that‚Äôs inherently unethical. I recommend looking up a list of what goes into making a smart phone. There are limited amounts of the elements required to produce electronic devices and smart phones on the earth. There is no game plan to recycle these precious metals from existing devices, slow down, or cease mining for these. Instead, every year there‚Äôs a new iPhone, regardless of how piddling and insubstantial the updates are on it. I am not advocating a Luddite, phoneless existence - I am just asking Apple be reasonable and build fewer, enduring products instead of a frenzied existence of endlessly churning out new products to make shareholders richer. Since my SE 2020 isn‚Äôt faring well, I stepped into an Apple Store to look at current offerings the other day. When I mentioned I was interested in an older model, the sales associated pretended to look shocked and said, ‚Äúare you ok being X # of phones behind?‚Äù. What an awful sales tactic- trying to shame or pressure customers to buy the latest and greatest, to be ‚Äúin‚Äù on the hype. It all makes me want to drop Apple versus continue to complicitly support their waste machine.

But the phone is easy to lose battery. and it becomes hotter than my android phone.\", 'My problem is with the Apple Inc policy that they do not allow OS updates for older, yet still working fine phones. Because of this policy, a phone that still works well cannot get the new OS required for other app updates. This is, to me, a FORCED CASH SPEND and it is also environmentally irresponsible. With this policy Apple consigns thousands of phones to the dump creating waste when they would not be there if people could get the latest OS update and be able to then properly use the third-party apps like InstaGram. Times are economically tough around the world these days. Why force people to spend unnecessarily? Why create more waste with phones sent to the dumpster when that waste is unecessary and can be fixed with a simple policy change allowing OS updates? As then Prince Charles said \"plastic has been placed on the menu\". Apple is placing more of it on the menu with this draconian policy of not allowing OS updates on older phone models like the iPhone5S. I would accept a small fee to update the OS on the iPhone 5S, but should not be forced to consign a working phone to landfill and spend new money on hardware just for an OS upgrade so I can properly use third-party apps.', \"I like Apple product.

What really upsets me is that the $5000 has been taken out of my bank account without the available credit on my card being updated. Now I don‚Äôt have that money in my bank account or the available credit on my card. The support team‚Äôs advice (for future payments) was to add money to Apple Cash and then use this to make Apple Card payments.

Especially after the loss of Steve Jobs, it seems that they became a company who is not focused anymore to user experience as before, but rather a company who is constantly trying to earn more and more without providing in return that much to their Clients. The quality of their products decreased dramatically as well, especially for certain types of products. For example we had to trash 6 AirPods because they became unusable after 2 years. The durability of some of their products are limited almost to the warranty period. After that they deteriorate dramatically or they become unusable. Lastly I purchased or had to purchase a new AirPods Gen 3 due to Apple Ecosystem I am involved in and they are falling out of my ear.

I came to the conclusion that some Apple-sheep can't understand technology and trends, therefore they can't even compare.To mention I never had before an Apple product.1. Bought an iPhone 13 mini. Lovely phone. Good for calling. Not good for writing messages (for my medium sized hands). I was kinda disappointed to see that the iOS is far from perfection, as it's marketed. Had lots of freezing, apps error and closing, hangings on loading iOS apps (not those from App Store). So there is went the myth with the perfect smartphone OS. I liked though that I could hear calls a bit better than on an Android smartphone I'm using in parallel. The speaker also sounds more bassy...2. AirPods 3rd Gen: I like them, they sound good, but not very loud. The battery depleted by itself many times, when not used. So I must charge them every week or so. I use some Huawei mostly, because they connect to two devices at once. The AirPods can't do that. And it's annoying.3. MacBook Air M1 (8GB, 256GB): I liked the MacOS. Mostly a good experience for programming, browsing, multimedia. Good speakers. But something I wasn't expecting: if (and I do lots of times) I have too many tabs opened in the browser, the browser (at least) freezes completely. I must to Force Quit the app from the Task Manager or what's called. When the RAM is full many apps are hanging too and it becomes useless. And I can't upgrade the RAM. And to buy 32GBs of RAM unit is out of discussion. It's extremely expensive. I'll have my Lenovo Legion 5 with 64GB of RAM and 3TBs on SSDs doing the hard job. Ahh, forgot: compared to Windows, waking the MacBook from sleeping mode happens instantly. This is really nice.4. iPad Mini 6 WiFi 64GB/ 5G & WiFi 256GB: bought the WiFi version to use it for navigation, as compared to an Android tablet it takes both Apple Maps and Google Maps (both they do great job). Learned the expensive way that the WiFi version doesn't have a GPS module. Lol. The cheapest possible Android tablet I ever had, it had GPS. You just tether your smartphone's WiFi and voil√†, you have internet on the tablet. Not on the WiFi version of this iPad Mini 6. So had to buy the Cellular version again. The latest works just fine. Lags sometimes with both navigation apps opened on split screen, but it's ok.5. iPad Pro 11 M1 2021 (8GB RAM, 128GB ROM): bought this for gaming and it's a monster. I even edited some videos and this thing is fast. Bought for my brother the Galaxy Tab S8 (8GB RAM, 256GB ROM, 5G) and the Samsung has more options for the user (Samsung DEX at least) and it came with a keyboard AND the pen. All for under 600¬£ with student price. Anyway, I still like iPad Pro. I bought a Logitech keyboard, as the original is way too expensive to worth. I'd buy the pen, but 120¬£? Really?Anyway, to end my review for Apple: it's just another company trying to lure the customers into buying their products. It's all about the money. But it's far from any perfection some fans are bragging. Before buying the 13 Mini, I bought a SE202 to see how's an iPhone. I had AppleCare+ for it. And sold it, but cancelling the Coverage can't be done through Apple platform. Must call them and it's hugely annoying. It's not something straight.\", 'Iphone is the best phone out there.

It has lasted a year and it died completely, fortunately I had apple care and they replaced my phone.   I also spent over $1000 buying an iPad Pro in 2019, that charger has also failed.   The apple symbol comes on for now when I turn it on but despite trying every charging port in the house and other houses, and buying new charging cables, it will not charge anymore.    I just looked to see how much it would cost to fix it and it seems that they\\'re quoting ¬£570 (I\\'m in the UK at the moment)    So my question is has Apple really \"gone downhill\" with their products?   I am going to the States shortly again and I was going to buy another MacBook and now it looks like iPad as well.   I guess the lesson learned is that you have to pay the Apple care monthly plan, if you do the annual plan you only get an extra year of cover.

I own an iMac 2019 Intel desktop, iPhone 14 Pro max, iPad 11\" Pro, M2 Pro Mac Mini, and a series 7 Apple watch, and a heap of accessories all of which are Apple branded. The iPhone and the iPad are about the best of the eco system. I wanted to award Apple only one star but admittedly some of their products are quite good. My focus of this review is more to do with the iMac 2019 and the Mac Mini. The 2019 intel iMac came with host of unforeseen issues, I bought this computer because I am disabled / diabetic etc, and the university recommended an Apple computer as it would come preloaded with software to assist me in completing a Masters degree. The software on the desktop did not work and to get it to work like it should have, there were additional steps that neither me or the tutor who came to my home were aware of, it was an added layer of a learning curve to which I did not need at a time when I required a computer that was supposedly easy to use. After I had completed my second degree successfully, the search for employment began, as you would expect, in the time that I have had the iMac desktop I have lost 4 job opportunities, this is due to the way MS Teams that for some unknown reason locks into a weird loop when there is an attempt to use it, when you speak to Apple Tech support they tell you that due to MS Teams being a third party software that it has nothing to do with them, it is like Apple is not designed to run third party softwares which everyone knows that is complete and utter rubbish, the real reason for them not assisting is because they do not know about their own product well enough to advise accordingly. The iMac desktop issues did not end there, saving MS Word documents became an ordeal as well, because for some reason, the amendments would not save and when they did the entire document was lost somewhere in a file. So iMac desktop is garbage, and the tech support is not much better, they will fob you at a drop of a hat, to get out of doing a job they are paid for! Then we come to the Mac Mini which was an infuriating buys experience - this is surrounding the compatibility of displays, mainly their own 2019 iMac desktop display. Apple has removed the Target Display Mode from before 2014 so the iMac 2019 cannot be used a display for the Mac Mini, this is a fact, and it was something that was constantly contradicted between tech support at Apple and, Apple\\'s own website, no one knew, no one knows, I had to dig up YouTube videos where other buys of this device confirmed that the Mac mini 2023 cannot be used with a 2019 Apple display, ironically, the Mac mini will work with any other display brand ... like Samsung?????? And it will definitely work along side the 1600 quid Mac Studio display, and it will work with any Mac desktop from BEFORE 2014. By then I had already bought and paid for this device, I am going on for teacher training early next year and I need an updated computer that will serve my current eco system so it was an arm twist in having to buy this device. The thing with Apple is that their claims on their own products are stated in half sentences or omitted completely, this serves as misleading and contemptible. If you buy a desktop with Apple make sure you do all of the back ground research before opting to pay for it. I have yet to feel delight, joy and satisfaction with an Apple product without having to buy this, that and the other for it to get proper functionality out of the device. When compared to Android, Microsoft - Apple\\'s only advantage is in its security features and built in privacy, but then as a consumer you should expect this due to Apple Pay. I have taken Apple to the ASA over what I truly believe to be a misleading sale on the Mac mini computer. There was one problem with the iPhone 12 Pro Max that I owned a last year before upgrading, the screen display for some peculiar reason magnified, the phone became inoperable as a result, in an attempt to get the handset back to normal the phone automatically called the Police three times, in the end the local constabulary contacted me to issue a formal warning that if I attempted any further hoax calls I would be subject to a prosecution! Jony Ives says using iPhone is \"intuitive\" that is his way of saying that it is common sense - I can tell you there was nothing intuitive about having to revive a screen on a phone that had by itself enlarged the display, for what reason would you require this feature on a handset? I had to use three fingers, then tap, and the screen would restore itself- not exactly intuitive if you didnt know. I find Jony Ives word insulting and compounds my feelings of raging hate towards Apple fully justified.', 'I got a new phone because I unfortunately smashed my old one.

I was then told to contact Apple to see would they authorise the repair but was passed to a manager who was very quick to tell me that I had mentioned European consumer law to one of his customer service agents and it was a legal process and they must adhere to the law. He clearly stated that Apple should have been informed within the two years but as I previously wrote above I incorrectly thought the warranty kicks in on activation. He did offer a replacement at approximately the cost of a new watch but I politely declined. If a two year warranty is a legal matter for Apple then why are their authorised sellers offering two year warranties. I would just encourage anyone thinking of buying an apple product to make themselves very familiar with the Apple warranty ( and what is included ) , it‚Äôs starting date and also their rights under European law. I would encourage consumers to contact Apple if they have any issues with their apple products well within their warranty period and to clarify if they are entitled to the extended warranty under European law ( at no cost ).

I called Apple got bounced around for an hour and was told by 2 people to trade it in meaning my brand new $500 watch would be worth $300 because of those 4 days.Wow.Steve Jobs may have been an a-hole but at least his Apple took care of the loyalists and wasn't as petty as Tim Cook's Apple.My request is in no way unreasonable but It does make me ask myself why I am loyal to a company that is not loyal to me.Great products overshadowed by terrible support and lack of loyalty to their hardcore base.\", 'Date of experience: June 23, 2023', 'Date of experience: September 26, 2022', 'Good service bad customer service unforunately', 'Why are you bashing a good company like Apple', 'iOS 16, in recent years Apple‚Äôs operating system has become over complicated and confusing, it used to be a simple customer friendly interface.

It may seem clean at first, but if you are trying to delete all files related to a software like Xcode, you will find there are hundreds of them laying in many different folders. You can delete some of them. For others you can\\'t even move them. And the Apple technician told me to delete all of them.3. Equating unreliable new features as innovation. For whatever reason, my touchbar flashes about every 1 minute. And there is the butterfly keyboard that jams and typessss several characters at a time.4. Slow and unprofessional support. So I tried to use the Apple Care to solve some of those issues. I tried to chat with them online 1st but they are not specialized in Xcode (my 2nd pt). I scheduled and went to an Apple shop and that person is still not specialized. They said they would call back and email me, but absolutely nothing happened. I ended up factory reset my mac after spending hours trying to do what I said in pt 2.5. Child porn iPhone news. No elaboration needed.6. Frequent slowing down of speed (for mac) accompanied by loud sound of the fans and heating up. Sometimes random weird stuff would happen if you haven\\'t restarted your mac for some time like Finder deciding you have no permission to open and change files you created. It is not a secret that Apple slows down old models before releasing new models of iPhone.7. Doesn\\'t support most games.8. Bluetooth feature (between mac and iPhone) that doesn\\'t work most of the time. It all depends on the mood of the mac if it lets your iPhone find it and airdrop a file.9. App issues. For example, Textedit issues like when you created a table and tried to enter something it becomes like this \"imgur. c0m Slash a Slash BOhpEtA\". Another example: Xcode prompted me to auto fix a line in the C++ library (not my own code) and proceeded to tell me I can\\'t do that.', 'They‚Äôre reasonable for customer support people Apple mainly says ‚ÄòYes‚Äô to customer support questions.

It took a bit getting used to iOS Big Sur, (being a fan of the older 80s & 90s software & even iOS Catalina) but I started to get along with it. The software was fine. Now, suddenly without me doing anything to introduce malware to my computer, I think Apple did so purposefully (since it is all digital and accessible by WiFi) just so they could spy to see what else they can force-sell to me.

In all honesty I know it‚Äôs nothing compared to their overall revenue that‚Äôs why someone like me being disgruntled means nothing to them but if they are managing to loose someone as loyal as me plus my connections, I am sure that they are loosing a lot more out there which will make a difference over time.', 'All in all, a good phone, but Apple seems to be more and more ‚Äúinvasive‚ÄùFor example - constant Audio volume   reducing.

My issues were fixed very fast', \"Thank you, Perge.Fantastic service this evening from Apple's 'Help & Support'. I registered help online and was called back within 5 minutes. I had to reset my AppleID account on a new device, however all the Apps, contacts, mail and calendar, phots etc did not restore. A very helpful customer assistant, 'Perge' took control of my iphone to resolve why. He erased my account details on the phone and then called my landline while the phone reset. 'Perge' then went through the ID reset with me. Within 10 minutes, all my apps, contacts, mail, calendar and photos, everything  had before were restored. I know Apple products cost more, the price is reflected in their after service support.  I'm so pleased they were there for support in my instance as all my appointments and 'life' are in the iCloud. I am really appreciative of Perge's patience with me, his product experience and knowledge, restoring everything I had to this new iphone I originally had on my previous device.\", 'The service is good, the products are good. Price high but that is understanable', \"I like Apple products when they work. I've had multiple products from apple: MacBook Pro, iPhones, iPad. From my experience, their laptops are really good quality but their smaller devices aren't that great. My first purchase ever from apple was an iPad 3rd generation (about 10 years ago) and let me tell you, it was so glitchy and it kept crashing. After multiple visits to the Apple Store, they replaced it for me for free; which made me happy because there was something wrong with it. With the iPhone 5, it was really good except the battery would drain almost completely after a few hours. With the iPhone 5, they would not cover it under the Manufacture's Warranty and said that the battery was fine when it clearly wasn't. Fast forward many years later, iPhone Xr is very good, fast, battery lasts for days. Point is, my experience with Apple is good when the product is good. When the product doesn't work, I am really upset. It's good when they try to resolve the issue. I do recommend the MacBooks though. My MacBook is almost 10 years old and it's still running really well. In case anyone's wondering, I never buy AppleCare, I just buy a really good case for the product so that the screen doesn't shatter if I drop it. Customer service at Apple is hit and miss. I know Apple likes to empower the customers by teaching them to troubleshoot instead of troubleshooting it themselves; I have mixed feelings about that because it can come off a bit lazy from the customer's perspective and it's not good for customers that aren't technologically savvy. I do think Apple is overpriced. I only purchased a new iPhone after using the previous one for many many years and there's too much glitches/issues with the product at that point.\", 'UNBELIEVABLE NEW IPHONE WITHOUT PLUG.I have just bought the new iPhone pro Max 250 GB. I did not know that it comes with a charger cable but not with the plug. WHAT ??? you spend 1,200 pounds to find out that you need to buy the plug to charge your mobile. HOW CHEAP IS THIS?? Yes, I know that Apple sucks you dry, but like this? I regret buying Apple, I should have stuck with Android. ABORT ABORT', 'The pro max 11 is a bad phone.

It's a brand new laptop and charger so I'm confused why this happens.\", \"Apple need to review their repair processes.The problem is not with the people but with the system. We have purchased a high spec MacBook Pro which unfortunately we have experienced multiple problems with within the first 6 months. (we also have a 7 year old MacBook Pro which we have had no problems with).Upon calling Apple our options were to return the machine and wait for up to two weeks to find out if it is repairable or to be replaced. Genius bookings are not available (which granted is not apples fault due to COVID)For us being without the machine is not an option which we of course explained to the help centre.With the prices apple charge and the whole foundation of the brand being built on the user experience there's a few options you would have hoped were suggested:- An express repair service - repaired or replaced within a few days (when you pay over ¬£2k for a laptop I don't think this is a big ask)- A courtesy machine (again I don't think a huge ask for apple to offer a courtesy machine as an option if people are going to be without their machine for up to two weeks through no fault of their own)- A replacement machine (as we have had to have 4 calls with you now for the machine that is less than 6 months old we're happy to replace it)These are just three options that could have been suggested... but none were offered. Even when we enquired about each we were told 'it's just not what we do'.We outlined that we were being told our only option was to continue to work off the faulty laptop and wait until shops were re-opened as we cannot be without the machine to which the response was 'when you put it like that, yes'This is a simple process that Apple needs to review... a little bit of effort goes a long way. Even the express turnaround option (which isn't the best) is still something that would have made us feel a little more valued and less likely to write a bad review.I'd like to stipulate that the customer service personnel were very professional and friendly, they just either have poor training on what options are available OR Apple just have terrible options available (I have a feeling it's the latter)I'm not writing this to give Apple a bad name, we're Apple product fans through and through. I'm writing in the hope that Apple read this and adapt to it. You can never please everyone, especially when you're the size of Apple but you can certainly do a better job and give your customer service teams something better to work with - I feel sorry for them.\", \"I don't understand why there are so so many bugs in Apple software?

They are very caring, make it personal, stick with you until your problem has been resolved, and they're always extremely patient - never getting frustrated, just super friendly people.

I was able to make an appointment with a Genius bar over the phone (lady on the phone was helpful, hence the 1st star). When I got to the Apple store in London it was chaotic. It looked like there were 3 different queues going on, clearly people all desperate to get their devices fixed before the second lockdown. Not surprisingly, I queued up for a good 30 minutes. When I finally got in, the 'Genius' told me the battery had failed ''cause I leave it plugged in when it's not being used''. That was the only advice I got. I said I hardly do, but according to him that was it. The Macbook is just over 2 years old, with a cycle count at 46...? And the battery fails and it's my fault..? I was trying to ask about consumer law as well but apparently batteries never fall under that.. So I had to fork out ¬£129 to replace the battery. The only good thing was that they had it replaced within a few hours, hence the second star. Other than that, the 'Genius' guy offered hardly any advice, I felt like I wasn't really listened to and having been out of a job for nearly 6 months I really could have done with a bit more help, especially bearing in mind they make MILLIONS. Disappointing customer service for such a recognised brand. I have always had Windows laptops before and never had any issues! The first time I bought a Mac may well be my last.\", 'Update: I was having issues with my MacBook Pro updating. I finally got it updated, but Apple support was no help at all. I‚Äôve also been having other issues. Apple has an issue right now where all of my devices keep having memory usage being filled in what they call the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù category. It‚Äôs to the point that I can‚Äôt update my devices because the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù category is using up almost all of the memory on my devices. Even if I delete all apps, photos, files, etc. On my devices there is still not enough storage. I‚Äôve chatted with Apple support a number of times and the ONLY way to fix they can give me is to do a full restart wiping ALL memory. Which is VERY frustrating and time consuming. I just have to keep using my Apple devices watching the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù category slowly taking up more and more memory until I need to do another restart wiping all of the memory from my devices and then set up the device again starting the whole process over. Apple has NO fix for this and the feeling I get is that this is planned obsolescence by Apple so customers will see their devices with no memory and many customers will find it easier to just buy the latest devices rather than spend time wiping the memory and restarting the device from scratch. I‚Äôm sure this is great for more business in the short term to get people buying new devices, but I no longer recommend Apple to others like I used to. I‚Äôm on the search for better devices.Original Review: Apple used to have good customer service. I‚Äôm not sure what happened, but now it takes forever to schedule an appointment at an Apple store. Then you still need to wait for help even with an appointment. Then the ‚ÄúGeniuses‚Äù at the Apple store seem to be mildly trained employees that take forever to figure out what the issue is. Today (11/12/20) my Mac won‚Äôt update, and Apple removed the chat option from customer service on their website, so if I want to get help, then they make you call them and wait on hold until someone is available to pick up the call. This is SO disappointing. They don‚Äôt even have an option to leave your phone number to call you when they‚Äôre ready, so you don‚Äôt need to wait on your phone for hours.', \"I've always had Apple iphones, what I don't like is that when you want the latest phone you've got to wait until your contract has ended.

She said that the apple watch may do the things I wanted. What cutting edge, out of the box, innovative features did I hope to have?1. A screen large enough so that I don't have to hold the device to my face to see the tiny letters; and large enough that I don't have to have a finger the size of a pencil to press tiny buttons on the screen.2. I wanted to be able to play music from the watch. NOT to have the watch just act as a middle-man between my smartphone music app. That's just stupid. Let me repeat, having a smart watch that just plays music via bluetooth from the smartphone then to headphones is something concocted by a special kind of stupid human. I want to have the music downloaded ON the smartwatch and played via bluetooth to headphones. You know, like how some MP3 players worked 10 years ago. So.... actually not original or innovative at all.3. I want a stopwatch. One that has a timer countdown before an auto-start. You know, like how many quality watches that costs about $100 or above can offer. But with a smartwatch, I need only tap on the screen to start, and tap again to stop. Because, and I know this sounds crazy and requires totally out of the box thinking, after running really fast, or performing an exhausting exercise that you're trying to time, it's infuriatingly annoying to have to find and press a button to stop the timer. Especially when your drenched in sweat and sweat is running in your eyes. Just tap the screen to turn on the auto-timer...wait for the beep countdown, and start training. As soon as you're done, tap the screen again. I KNOW, I KNOW, This kind of innovative, genius thinking is beyond the high-paid designers at Apple.4. I know FOUR things. But this is the last one. Ready? This will blow your mind. I would like a watch (especially one that costs nearly half a grand) to display my heart rate at all times. Have it in a corner of the screen. Because, and I know this is expecting far too much, but while I'm physically exerting myself doing interval training, I would like to simply look at my watch and get my heart rate. I don't want to have to press a button on the screen. Wait for the results and wait to see the data. I don't want to carry Apple's brick of a smartphone that I must also wrap with a large protective covering, because iPhones are fragile as overpriced fine china.Well, I got this iWatch piece of garbage. Charged it. Set it up. I downloaded Spotify (because I stopped using Apple's terrible music service a lone time ago). Oh, one can see a parallel between Apple's worsening quality of products, lack of innovation, and idiotic ideas with the slow demise of what was once a great music platform: iTunes.Apple failed to deliver yet again. I couldn't do not a single thing I mentioned above. A $500 watch failed to do any of the things I listed because of lazy design, needless app restrictions, or design flaws.\", 'I purchased a ipad mini 4, 18 months ago from Argos. During lock down  i Face timed my daughter, then left it on table untill the evening when i went to use it again it was  completely dead. would not charge. i contacted a company near me . apple repair company. they have justed opened this week.

Where Apple excels is the integration and how Apple devices seamlessly communicate in between.  Apple has fantastic stores with lovely staff working there and easily accessible support. Now, that support is not as bad as Google and Samsung, but simply can't help in anything Apple ID-related - they say ‚Äùwe can't do anything, we left all the power to the user‚Äù and, well, I can't do anything - all my changes (misspelt email) are permanent. They don't allow me to do anything about it, and they refuse to do anything. At least they're polite while not helping.\", 'I thought it important to write about the Apple IPAD PRO which I bought 6 months ago - it is not ideal for doing work (ie writing documents or doing anything detailed in perhaps excel or google docs etc), as It‚Äôs very skittish, it can easily tap on another area of the screen with or without your pen, and with or without you noticing, then you lose your train of thought as to what you were trying to do as you have to backtrack and amend so many typos....  so if you need to work on important detailed documents with lots of information, unless you are always on the move I would just buy a laptop, which is what I‚Äôm going to have to do now. The iPad Pro in my view is only good for image related stuff eg Pinterest, making hand written notes or drawing on Adobe Fresco (which is amazing technology).', 'I have long been a Customer of Apple and the ITunes Store but am increasingly frustrated that they remove items and then say to customers ‚Äúit‚Äôs been withdrawn by the supplier, if you haven‚Äôt saved it on an external hard drive, hard luck‚Äù.

It worked well the first year, but after that is has been nothing but trouble. Been to the service center many times. Had my Apple Smart Keyboard replaced, but the screen becomes unresponsive more and more, for several seconds and at completely random times. On the internet, it is a known problem.Also on my MacBook Pro I suffer from serious software problems. The days are gone that I could recommend Apple products. IF and only IF they work as they should, they are great.Changed from 1 star to 2 stars, since the software problems on my Macbook appear to be solved by updates and my MacBook Pro is now working great.Somewhat reluctantly changing the review from 2 stars to 3 stars. Bought an LG 5k Ultrafine USB-C monitor which arrived with a nonfunctioning camera in the monitor. Have been on the phone with AppleCare for hours trying to see if there was a software problem, but couldn't find anything. Then returned the monitor to Amac and received a new one the next day with working camera. The monitor in combination with my Macbook is simply superb: one USB-C cable for powering my Mac, for the video signal to the monitor, for the microphone and the camera. Well done Apple!

I saw a review that said it was to make it more user friendly. How exactly? By making everyone that buys a phone have to buy Bluetooth? or making them use earpods that have can only be used when not charging? the earpods make my ears hurt so i thought OK ill buy an adaptor and use my old earphones but has anyone seen the reviews of the official apple adaptors? i would have thought that by now someone at apple would have gone \"hmm maybe we should make this product better so that people want to buy them.

If people are spending that much why not give them airpods with the phone? or even the adaptor for the jack?(although the adaptor is trash). All you get in the box for an xr is the charger, the phone, the earpods and some paper.

Apple should take step to shut those unauthorised showrooms.', 'Over the past 6 years, My wife and I were big Apple fans and have purchased Apple iPhone 5s, iPhone 6s, and iPhone X along with other Apple computing and entertainment products for the home and personal lifestyle. Out of the 10 Apple products we have purchased over the past 6 years, three devices became non functional requiring replacement or repairs.  All three devices became corrupt and just stopped working (not due to damage) after the warranty period requiring expensive repairs.  Our oldest Apple laptop (one of the first models released) is still working with no issues other than being a dinosaur. Thirty percent of our Apple products failed over 6 years.  We have other \"Non Apple\" branded computers/gaming consoles/cameras/cell phones dated back to early 2000\\'s which are still working when turned on with no problems (just outdated).  I\\'ve never had as many failure problems with other electronic brands until we started buying Apple products.  We thought we just we were having bad Apple luck. Seems the newer Apple products are attractive in design with interesting/competitive features to draw customers in and compete with other brands, however not designed as durable as older products or some competitors.   My opinion is that Apple has changed the strategy of building quality and durable products in the past that were very reliable to a current eye catching attractive products with a lot of want to be cool features that looks upscale with a high $$$.$$ price tag but, lacking in quality and durability with glitches/problems from trying to push a new product out every year.   The final straw which made me decide to steer away from Apple was the fact that Apple has pulled some sneaky moves on products in the recent past to include poor quality glass on iPhone screens, battery issues that were well known about, as recently has removed the iPhone X from their website to the point I couldn\\'t find a manual for my iPhone X that I just purchased in July 2018 or find support titles for my phone.   Hmmm....... Call me crazy but, what\\'s up with that?  Why are we hiding support documents and info for the Anniversary iPhone X?   Probably should verify my Apple Care Plus is still activated and showing on my account too?It\\'s obvious Apple\\'s current strategy in the business is to attract as many new customers as possible and make a huge profit as quickly as possible with as many products as possible (rightfully so) however, not at the expense of quality, reliability, and honesty which in turn pushes the loyal customer towards other brands as you can see.    Selling the new iPhone XS for $999 in 2018 versus 2017 iPhone X model for $999 is awesome for customers who waited a year later to see what Apple has been working on and what they were going to reveal.   A year later for same price, you get basically the same iPhone X with some enhancements and the nearly a year old iPhone X gets completely removed from the website?  IF THAT DOESN\\'T SEND CUSTOMERS A MESSAGE, FOLKS NEED TO WAKE UP\".   Apple wonders what\\'s going on with their sales?  Read what I just wrote, put yourself in the customers shoes, and ask yourself if you would want to buy an Apple iPhone or Apple product from this experience.   Folks are on to the Apple trends and will not buy Apple products until they see enough reviews online to prove it\\'s worth the steep purchase now or wait another year.  Apple is turning into a business like a cable company.  All about getting the new customer but after the first year, hard to keep a customer loyal.  It does leave a bad taste in my mouth though with the way they just removed iPhone X like it never existed and still have older phones prior to iPhone X still listed on their website.  I think the iPhone X was and is my last Apple product purchase.   My wife feels the same way.Apple, not sure if you are listening or reading but, my recommendation would be to \"SLOW DOWN\", focus on quality solid products and don\\'t worry about what new cool product needs to be ready for manufacturing in January 2019 after September 2018 release of current products (4 months later).  Why not operate like Honda and Toyota, don\\'t forget about the loyal fans and customers who currently have last years products, let the product be used, get feedback, focus on fixes, then when it\\'s time to release the next fancy product, it will be shocking to everyone.  It would be nice to see Apple to work out a plan and come out with a fix to some issues with the product you just released last year.  Fix the glitchy iPhone X Face ID for last years customers.  Don\\'t leave them to sit and watch a better product for the same price come out with no hope for a fix to last years model, just delete it so we don\\'t have to deal with it.  it\\'s just wrong and makes a bold statement that you have no time for last years stuff, focus is currently on whats now in production.  Seems like you\\'re missing a team of engineers to focus on ongoing known issues. We wish Apple the best but, I think we are tired of these trends.  Apple is not what it was years ago and it shows.   The new releases every September are no longer interesting.  It leaves me with negative thoughts from past experiences and we just want to look the other way.Sorry so negative but, we speak from the heart and the truth.Sincerely,', 'While I enjoy the products, the service aspect is lacking at best.

I Ordered a MacBook Pro recently with the educational promotion through Apple for school this semester. The system processed half of my order and not the other so I wasn't going to receive my product. I went through hours of customer service calls (which were a nightmare). They would put me on hold for 20+ minutes at a time and still not answer any of my questions. I was then passed around to many different people, none of which could help me fix the problem. They would try to send me back to previous people I had spoken with and then provide me with invalid extensions just to get me off the line. Even a week after my refund and product cancelation from the system, they still couldn't figure out how to let me order my MacBook. When I finally got it ordered under someone else's Apple ID, I paid more for the express shipping so that I would get in within the next couple of days for school and they didn't even respect that request. They didn't ship my order until after the date I originally paid for it to arrive at my house. I then had to go through more calls, transfers and holds to get a refund on the extra I paid for my shipping. I had originally attempted to purchase my MacBook a couple of weeks before school started but did not end up receiving it until a couple weeks into the semester. Completely ridiculous.

Apple was carrying the Job\\'s service values into the market, backing them up with faultless customer support and offering a genuinely alternative consumer experience.Now, sadly, those values have been lost in Apple\\'s relentless drive for increased commercial expansion and profiteering. The technical consistency that was a hallmark of Apple products has gone - my problems with my newish iMac provide a relevant example:     ‚Ä¢ About 2-3 years ago I updated my iMac just before going into hospital for several weeks. When I returned home I found my iMac overrun with \"duplicate files\". My documents folder had increased from 3gb to over 90gb, my contacts had suffered severe duplication along with several entries being completely deleted. My \"Pages\" library, containing my work-documents, was in a state of complete chaos with duplicated and missing documents. My iTunes library was also in a similar state of chaos. I rang Apple, expecting them to invite me to take my iMac to their store where, hopefully, they would sort it out. No invite was given and instead I was urged to sort it out myself with help from telephone support. So began a long series of phone calls with Apple support - I tried to keep my number of advisors to a minimum but this proved to be impossible. Involuntary \"File Duplication\" is a complex issue and very, very few Apple Support Advisors have the least idea of how to tackle it, instead they will lead you blindly through procedures that will leave you in a state of utter chaos and confusion. Apple telephone support works best with quick-fix problems that can be solved in 10 minutes or so, it DOES NOT WORK with extensive problems that require joined-up thinking over several weeks.If I were to invoice Apple at my professional rate for time spent on this issue (a procedure on which I am taking legal advice) they would find themselves looking at a invoice of several thousand pounds.

Black screen, no response, no power up - nothing.  Went to Apple store and updated to latest software, only for phone to repeatedly die, as witnessed by the receptionist person. Receptionist person said if it's a hardware fault we'll certainly replace the phone.  Still had to wait an hour for a 'Genius' to see me to confirm what receptionist had already seen - yes, software updated, yes, phone dies repeatedly with visible screen glitch.  Ran lots more tests to confirm, indeed it was more than a software issue but then refused to replace with new phone.  Insisted 'the process' was that I accept a iPhone 6 on loan for two weeks while they send off the malfunctioning phone. First loaner phone didn't even work, as I noticed before leaving with it. My pleas that any premium brand would normally offer a new replacement on the spot where it's self-evidently not fit for purpose fell on deaf ears.  All the genius could say, on repeat, was 'It's the process' and the even less helpful 'I know where you're coming from'. It would have been more honest to simply say 'Computer says No.' Hopelessly inadequate.  I can't think of any other expensive tech product where the manufacturer wouldn't be falling over themselves to apologise and instantly replace rather than increasing your frustration by giving you the liability of a loaner phone while they muse over what particular manufacturing or parts fault has led to an expensive but rubbish product. I have no idea how long they will take as they couldn't tell me. I only got this because of a manufacturing design error in the iPhone 6 Plus I had before which succumbed to 'Touch Disease' as written about on the internet and now the subject of class action lawsuits in the USA.

After screen sharing with them new issues arise and the old issue is still not fixed.  I have had support people who can not even understand the problem and have to ask others for advise while I am on hold.  The level of knowledge amongst support is very variable.  For what these devices cost I expect them to work and get seamless support.  I do not expect perfection, the devices are very complicated.  But it seems the right hand is not talking to the left.  And for 4 times what a similar laptop would cost I expect support.  Another issue is the absolute complexity of their web site support pages.  I have counted 5 ways to get in touch with support, and all have different web pages.  Their CHAT while using proper grammar and language gives really poor advice.  ALWAYS talk to a person.  ALWAYS.   Another thing to watch our for is when they update the OS.  Their eco-system is so compliocated and inter-connected it creates ripples throughout your entire computer.

I expected them to send me a new keyboard and I would send back the faulty one in the original box which I kept.He couldn't assure me that the Apple store in Brussels would exchange the product or would take it in for repair. I really can't imagine how a smart keyboard can be repaired. It would 'only take a couple of days'.

This would have been a great experience, except it wasn't. I first reported the problem to Apple well over a month ago after trying all the fixes I saw online. Boy was the internet full of stories just like mine.  I was told they couldn't help me until I gave them my serial number off the keyboard which was unreadable. I took a picture and sent it to Apple where they were able to read it. I was then told that if I give them my credit card info they would send me a box to return the keyboard, they would look at it and then decide whether to replace it for free or charge me for another one. I refused to give my credit card info. Please just send me a box and let me send you the keyboard. It took several chat's and phone calls this last month to finally get someone to send me a box. When they finally did I packed up the keyboard and sent it off. 4 days later it was back. When I opened the box I didn't know what to expect because there was no info from Apple. What did they do? Is it a new keyboard? No? Did you fix it? Looks like it. Now all is well.

The only thing offensive is the company\\'s attitude towards it\\'s customer base. Please allow me to explain.  We own many Apple iPhones and other products.  I visited the Evergreen Walk store in South Windsor Ct  on June 23rd to amongst other things, purchase an iPhone.  As we completed the very long and horribly tedious process of purchasing the phone using the 0% monthly payment plan, My 770 credit score was denied.  Yes that is right DENIED.  The \"process\"  includes recording your drivers license, your credit card for automatic charges to your account, and collection of your SS # and birthdate.  I work very hard to maintain excellent credit but 3 years ago I was sued for $274. for a medical bill I disputed. I lost (I could not make it to court that day) and paid the $274 to the undeserved medical company for a duplicate payment for a medical test.  ALL that information becomes a part of your credit history.  And yes my credit score is still 770, since it had occurred far enough in the past.  I even very recently refinanced my mortgage and took out a home equity Loan on my house without any problems.  Citizen One financial however does not review your credit, if you have an unsatisfactory score or in my case a \"judgement\" you are denied, period.  Neither company apparently has anyone smart enough to read a credit report.  Citizen One claims that the standards are put in place by Apple, not sure I believe them though.

Repair No: R234957421. A few days ago, when I dropped my new iPhone 6S the first time ever, its screen has shattered.After that, I place the iPhone inside the protective case, and a week later I took it to Apple Yorkdale for screen replacement.Inside the Apple Yorkdale store I stumbled across many poorly designed business practices and procedures which make Apple customers look stupid and guilty when actually they are not.LIST OF EVENTS:1.The black guy who accepted my phone for repair, take a close look at my iPhone, but did not draw my attention to any scratches, and even did not mention about them at all! He just asked to read a half page of text and put signature on a touchscreen. Me, as many of you, made a mistake by not reading the text carefully, thinking that it was a standard legal bla-bla-bla and I just signed it.2. When I received my phone from repair, I noticed the scratch in the LOWER RIGHT corner and reported it to the dark beard guy who was releasing my iPhone after screen replacement. I expected that Apple will replace the scratched part, and that‚Äôs it. The guy printed out the Genius Bar Work Authorization form, which to my great surprise in the ‚ÄúProblem Description/Diagnosis‚Äù section stated (quote): ‚ÄúIssue: Custormer reportsPhone fell and glass crackedSteps to Reproduce: Visual verificationMRI. ‚Äì passCosmetic condition: Display cracked ‚Äìimpact point TOP LEFTLight surface scratchesEmployee 1130550164‚ÄùI did not remember any scratches in the LOWER RIGHT corner, and I firmly believed at that time that there was none when I passed my phone for repair. I asked the dark beard guy to contact the black guy who took my phone and confirm with him that there was no mentioning of any scratches before repair. He answered that that black guy had already left and cannot be reached. I am not that stupid, and I am sure that this standard ‚ÄúLight surface scratches‚Äù phrase is either automatically inserted by the Apple software, or routinely inserted by Apple employees who take iPhones in for repair, as insurance from customer complaints about pre-existing scratches. I understand their point, but it makes all customers automatically guilty when accidental scratch is made by Apple employees. Just do not tell me that it never happens \\uf04aHere are the flaws in Apple business procedures when my iPhone was taking in for repair (and I suspect they are systemic flaws for Apple as a whole):-Apple employee did not draw my attention to pre-existing scratches;-Apple employee did not take pictures of the iPhone‚Äôs back and sides which would allow Apple to prove its position if a complaint is made; 3. I asked to speak with somebody from the Apple store management team. Some grey beard guy came to me. His body language was explicitly saying: ‚ÄúDude, stop wasting my time!‚Äù Again, he referred to the ‚ÄúLight surface scratches‚Äù and said that he cannot help me with my complaint.Finally, I was asked to sign a two page long legal disclaimer, which I have read carefully this time, and I made a handwritten note above my signature about the newly discovered scratch.Here are the flaws in Apple business procedures when my iPhone was release after the repair (and I suspect they are systemic flaws in Apple as a whole):-The employee who was taking phone in for repair cannot be reached;-The touchpad for customer‚Äôs signatures is oversensitive, and it took me SEVERAL attempts to right my comment above the signature because several times I accidentally pressed the ‚ÄúClear‚Äù link on the screen;-The employees who participated in the conflict resolution discussion did not introduce themselves, and I am almost sure they are not added their notes and employee numbers to the Genius Bar Work Authorization form as a conflict resolution participants.I hope, that somebody from Apple will read this feedback, and pass the flaws to the upper management for review.Overall, this visit to Apple Store changed my impression about Apple to worse, and their employees do not look trustworthy any longer for me.I hope that my complaint will make potential customers think twice before purchasing from Apple!-----------MY ADVICE TO APPLE CUSTOMERS: Take in the Apple store another camera, and make pictures in presence of Apple employee before passing them your Apple product for repair!', 'Date of experience: May 08, 2017', \"Have had my iPad Air 2 for a while now and really anticipate the Air 3 but the guys down in my local Apple depot in the city creek centre don't have dates for it yet.

So we waited about 15 minutes and a woman staffer comes up to address our questions -- then this clapping and cheering breaks out. The staffer asks us to wait until the commotion settles down before proceeding, but it went on and on and on... turns out another staffer was leaving after his final shift and this was the way employees are sent off. This was extremely annoying because he stopped to hug every employee with brief conversations. This continued --while we THE CUSTOMERS -- waited because our staffer had joined in the cheering and clapping for the duration of this activity. Ok -- I get the team connection, but Apple, there would be no team if not for the consumer. By the time this episode wrapped up I was ready to leave and make no purchase but we stuck it out to get our questions answered. And frankly the staffer was not very knowledgeable.

If a third party product & it goes wrong they immediately go into deflect & total non-responsibility mode. Under British Law they must replace a product with 30 days.

Yes, I tried pushing the home button and the on/off button for 10 seconds...I got the apple logo, then it died again. I tried holding them for 45 seconds while plugged into iTunes and got the update/restore screen. Unfortunately, the phone would not update or restore properly. I tried the online Apple support and got no help other than mentioning the things I had already tried. His solution was to try a different computer. Eventually the phone actually did go through a total restore and then update from my last back up using the computer I had been on all along. I was frustrated to have spent 6 hours messing with it, but relieved to have my phone back. I went to bed more happy than not. In the morning, I overslept because the phone had died again while plugged in. We were back to square one...black screen, apple logo fading away...ready to cry or scream or both, I made a Genius Bar appointment at the location 45 minutes from home. I know I am lucky to have one that close, but it is still quite a drive when coupled with the two and a half hours spent in the store. The technician was ok. She did what she could but couldn\\'t fix the phone. She eventually said I would get a new phone, but then said oh no, wait you only get a loaner. We have to send this one in to be repaired.

Consequently I contacted Apple a number of times, both in stores and at the support phone centre for help and advice.So far the advice has consisted of;Reboot it (duh - think I haven't already tried that a million times?!)Erase and restore itRestore it as a new device rather than from a backup The various people I've spoken with have run their diagnostics and reported that there are no errors and the battery appears to be fine (although my experience shows it's far from fine), and so as they can't diagnose a fault they won't repair or replace.Finally this week, after months of battling with the issue Apple have announced that they're aware of a Shutdown Flaw affecting some iPhone 6S devices which has exactly the symptoms I'm experiencing, and so I gleefully called the support team, as I can finally get some support on the issue.  The support guy I spoke with was actually very good and checked my serial number and confirmed that mine was in the batch which has the fault, but really all he could do was book an appointment with a Genius bar as the device would need to be repaired or replaced.  I confirmed I wished to have it replaced as the overheating battery may have affected other components, and realistically I have that option under the UK's Consumer Rights Act.  Unfortunately there were only 3 slots open in the London Covent Garden store, a week away.  As I really wanted this resolved sooner the advisor suggested I drop in to an Apple store and speak to a manager, as it was a relatively easy resolution; simply swap the device for a new one - Apple already know it has a manufacturing fault so no diagnostics are needed.As advised, I dropped into the London Regent Street branch (slightly easier to get to for me than Covent Garden) and asked for a manager, and was directed to a Mr Sharma. The 'manager' seemed to have difficulty understanding the story and was intent on making me a Genius bar appointment, for which he had a 5-6 hour waiting list.  I tried to explain that I didn't need any technical help, I just needed a replacement, but he wasn't listening.  He was rude and dismissive, and when I told him that I didn't want to wait for 5 hours he told me to leave the store as I didn't have any business being there if I didn't want to have technical help or buy a product!As I'd been unsuccessful at Regent Street I proceeded straight over to Covent Garden and again asked for a manager, adding some background for him and my thoughts about how Apple support was worsening - he didn't like that I wasn't happy with the service, but instead of sympathising and trying to recover the situation he seemed to become aggravated - not a great way for a 'manager' to deal with a consumer.  He did, however, get me to a Genius bar technician about an hour later.When I finally sat down with the Genius bar technician he didn't perform any diagnosis, he simply booked it for a replacement (which could have been done on the phone, or by any of the members of Apple staff I'd spoken to already), however as it's their standard policy booked it for a recycled device, despite my understanding that I would receive another new device to replace my faulty one.  As they don't hold stock I have to return in 3-5 days to swap it over.After leaving the store I checked with Which's legal team and they confirmed that under the Consumer Rights Act I do have the right to demand a brand new device, as that's what I purchased, and so I called the support team again.  After spending 40 minutes on the phone with them the senior advisor finally worked out that I'd need to speak to Covent Garden again about ensuring the replacement was for new and not recycled and transferred me to the branch.  A woman answered, said 'hello? hello?' and then hung up.I'm on to the support team again, this time I'm 24 minutes in and still nowhere.Not sure what I have to do to get Apple to resolve this.  Right now I'd settle for them even fulfilling their legal obligations.After decades of using Apple and tens of thousands of pounds of expenditure I'm about ready to stop using Apple entirely.  Great hardware but atrocious customer service when things go wrong.  It's hardly 'it just works', it's more 'when it doesn't work it's a nightmare'.\", 'I\\'m done. 5 iPhones and two iPads later I\\'m done. The deceptive trade practices in the form of \"updates\" is finally enough. Being a huge fan and supporter of apple products has become increasingly difficult. I\\'m tired of my technology investments becoming gradually slower and bug riddled by updates. It is my opinion there are two primary reasons for the constant updates. One is spying via data mining and the other is the gradual pursuit of eventually outdating products via updates. So I\\'ll purchase a dumb phone next time I need one and no more purchases through the Apple Store. Apple, you have officially been boycotted from this point forward. I\\'m sick of the constant pop up screens informing me I need to update. So please \"update\" your customer list and remove one person.

I try to be fair, but I\\'m also just. I understand Steve Jobs isn\\'t here and won\\'t be coming back (rest his soul), but Apple must chill. EVERY time you turn around there\\'s a \"new\" iPhone. Where? Where is the new iPhone, Apple? You adjust the camera, maybe add some pigmentation to the backlight, or there\\'s some promise of \\'improvement\\' in the system altogether. How is that new? How IPHONE, how!? You overprice your items and you over produce a name that stands as a great functioning system without you guys always tinkering away on something I find to be useless. Another \"home\" app that\\'s unnecessary or an IOS update that\\'s always CHANGING everything. You take away small, but useful tweaks and auction it off as a \"step up\" when all it does is irritate me. LEAVE THE PHONE ALONE, and focus on things that matter, like actually making the Alarm work. Can we start there? Or adding personalization that isn\\'t so constricting and BORING. Yes, this review was written with anger, but again, we\\'re drawn back to my statement about fairness, but to be \"just\" as well. I try to give the new updates a chance, for one, they\\'re too frequent to ignore and one (myself) starts to see a decline in performance to where I\\'m forced to upgrade, and for two, I\\'m hoping that Apple will fix their gaps in their operating system. Each time, I\\'m disappointed and I\\'ve been with Apple for years. Loyalty keeps me here as opposed to switching to Android, but I\\'ve thought on many occasions to just doing it anyways and saving myself the headache of another \"iPhone release\". I understanding having to keep up with demands of a fast paced market, but it gets to a point where you guys start to overlook the needs of the customers to fill your own pockets...and call it capitalism all you want, but it\\'s the consumer that keeps the company at bay. The IPhone 7 is a joke and I have an IPhone 6. I haven\\'t even had this iPhone long enough to be comfortable, let alone think about an upgrade. The replacement of the headphone jack was ridiculous and all part of some ploy to give the phone something \"new\", but again \"unnecessary\". Marketing Apple Wireless EarPods? Really? What if they fall out? Is there a tracking system? Or perhaps an automatic refund when they\\'re lost in the shuffle of life? I doubt it, Apple, I doubt it. Have several seats and just enjoy being a great company that honestly does make great products.

But, lately, Apple products seem needlessly overloaded with too many bells and whistles that I suspect 99 % of their customers don't really use, and they aren't nearly as intuitive as they once were.  And, they have become seriously expensive.  I wouldn't mind the expense so much if they still delivered top line customer service, but this experience is causing me to consider returning to PC's.

Apple was always something intriguing to me that I wanted to learn more about as I grew up with all Microsoft products. Within the past year I got a MacBook Pro, an Air 2, and have been contemplating the IPhone 6S. I had one rough patch when Apple Care would not repair the MacBook that my son literally sprinkled his sippy cup over when I had by far worse accidents repaired by Geek Squad at Best Buy with no issues. Long story short, we ended up working out a compromise, despite the surprise with their lesser coverage in comparison. When it came to Apple, I had superior expectations with everything do to so many positive reviews from products and customer support. Also, with the price point to what most would consider a premium quality product.\\rTonight really took the cake. I had an absolutely DISGRACEFUL experience with the closing manager at the South Windsor Connecticut store. \\rLet me start with the fact that I have been working in retail for at least past decade of my life now and I know that more and more of large scale corporations are leaning towards online sales. This is out of \"convenience\" to the customer (or in my opinion a way of hiring less store employees across the board in a company), companies have set their sales up so that a customer can purchase an item for a quick pick up that very same day at a nearby location. Again, this is supposed to be a \"convenience\" to the customer.\\rSo, tonight I did just that and purchased a typical IPad Mini that most all Apple locations readily have on hand. On the order it said \"Pick up: Available Today\". It did also state that there would be a confirmation email when the order was ready to be picked up. I did not have time to wait as I only had the free time to pick it up before the store closed so I headed in that direction thinking logically as most would that how much time do they need to get a stock item on their shelf \"ready\". Heck, I don\\'t mind waiting a few minutes for them to prepare things if need be.\\rI headed in and they greeted me after a few moments and I told them that I was ready to pick up my item. They started to look it up, but couldn\\'t find anything which made me concerned as I process credit and loans in my retail position all the time. So, I understand the speed in which transactions process electronically and had the expectation of Apple being an efficient company.\\rThe young lady who helped me, called Apple Online Customer Service to question it further. During the end of that call, so she proceeded to tell me that the order was placed on a 24 hour hold for fraud which was even more upsetting. I glanced at my email on my phone to see that the order had processed on my credit card . She then advised me to call Apple Online Store back to speak with verification (rather than connecting me herself to someone). \\rI called them back myself to get a woman who told me that it takes 24 hours to process the sale and there was nothing they could do other than have me drive back tomorrow (which was a time that I was not available after already driving an hour round trip to/from that location), but that there was no holds or fraud notifications on the order. She suggested that I spoke to a verification specialist about the fraud and then transferred to me to a menu that kept asking me to punch in an extension which further frustrated me.\\rI then asked the young lady in the store if I could speak with a manager who could help clear things up as I had come so far. So, this older man who was the manager that evening immediately confronted me after speaking with her. He aggressively asked if I had received the email that it was ready for pick up. I said no, but it said ready today and I did not have the time to wait before closing. He cut me off and argued that I was wrong for even bothering to come in for that item without any confirmation of it being ready. At the point I purchase that item, it is MINE. I should not have to be told when I can have it when I am a paying customer. That 24 hour hold is a CROCK if I ever did hear one. I sell orders for thousands of dollars in my retail position via online for immediate pick up in store. My order was a measly three hundred something dollars which any fraud department would have squared away in no time. I said maybe I should of bought it from Best Buy and they would let me pick it right up. He encouraged me to go ahead!! He continued to argue with why I was wrong (something that you should NEVER do in retail with your customer). He then just turned his back to me and walked off as I called my friend asking what I should do as I was extremely upset and on the verge of canceling it. If it wasn\\'t for the fact that I am leaving the state before this weekend and this wasn\\'t a gift for my friend who wanted this particular device badly, I surely would have!\\rThis has been one hell of a first year dealing with Apple and I am completely turned off.', \"Got the new iphone 6 but no headphones? the package was empty? blooming heck apple!

I had been an iPhone enthusiast for some years. In November, after downloading the new Yosemite operating system, my Macbook would only reboot about a third of the way. Since I had purchased AppleCare, I called for help (waited 50 mins to speak to the person that could help at all) I was directed to a Senior Associate who was very helpful. These were the steps: (1) put in a order for an engineer to recommend a solution and his answer would take 4 days (2) then the Associate called and informed me on what to do and the computer had to set for the rest of the day to finish the first process (3) next day- more steps (4) purchased a 100.00 external hard drive--finally a working computer after 7-8 days.

Associate: You are gonna have to take your Macbook over to MacAuthority or somewhere and have your data backed up (which you will have to pay for) and then bring it back here after that and we will clear your computer and reinstall our software.\\rMe: Could I possibly loose some of my data? for instance, I probably have 3-4000$ worth of Nursing Textbooks and several research papers just to name a few things.\\rAssociate: We don\\'t deal with your data, that will be your responsibility--Apple is only responsible for putting our software back on there.\\rMe: (in my ignorance) So if iCloud doesn\\'t back up my data what is it for?\\rAssociate: its only our responsibility to make sure the software is on there and your responsible for your data.\\rIn conclusion, I wanted to post this article to let those of you that are considering an Apple product to realize a few facts:\\r1. if you download a new operating system or an update by Apple and it screws up your computer-[to my surprise]-all Apple can offer you is to clear your computer, reinstate their software (after you have paid to have your data backed-up) and your left with possible loss of data that they don\\'t deal with.\\r2. AppleCare only covers the hardware of the computer and allows you to call and get help if you don\\'t understand something-\\r{I know Apple is having major software issues, because I previously have called in the past and spoken to someone in about 5-10 mins max--now when you call its 45-60 mins to get to a human}--I should have taken the customer service guy\\'s advice that told me that if it was him he wouldn\\'t download the Yosemite until all the bugs were worked out of it.\\r3. Just because Apple was once an awesome company does not mean they are concerned about the same things that are important to you--just go online and try to find a number that you can talk to someone in their complaint department....let me know if you find such a number. Also, don\\'t think that Apple will make sure you always have a working computer whether you have AppleCare or not.

Instead of focusing on what's most important like innovating and coming with new product ideas that inspire us, now all they do is add a little bit more ram, a little more memory, a little bit bigger screen, and just make incremental improvements. Nothing that really Wows you. I guess they couldn't just wow us forever but I hoped they would. Anyway, I still use mostly all Apple products for my day to day work and activities.

Their products are expensive but they last longer so you probably recuperate the extra cost.

Soon as you have this and pc's are not far away you will be onto a total winner!!!!\", 'I have never been an Apple fan. Their equipment  is exceptionally well designed but carries an expensive price tag. Perhaps the good thing is they manufacture the hard and software so standards are high. However the iPhone, itouch, and ipad  are definately the manufacturer telling the customer what to they will have. Only giving them model choices that should not exist. Why not have a slot for memory expansion, why not have an accessible battery? This was a poor decision that certainly cost them the phone and tablet market.\\rNow because of the moronic approach of windows 8 I am going to  an Apple laptop.

Of course they used the Covid excuse. I then get there at 3:15pm and this young woman (looked like she just escaped from primary school) came out and told me to come back at 4:15pm laughing under her breathe because she thought I couldn't tell the time.

I asked if they could push down another pack on my device since I paid for two and Apple refused to refund me for the duplicate charge.

How can a company arrogantly state that they know they double charged you, but refuse to refund the second one. It‚Äôs beyond me. Well, keep the $10.

I believe it is essential to provide feedback when customers face issues, in the hope that it can lead to improvements in the future.Recently, I received a small sum of money (less than $100) via the Apple Cash app, which prompted a sudden and unexpected request for extensive personal information verification. This included my name, address, email, the last four digits of my social security number, and then also my full social security number. Understandably, given recent incidents of fraud on another credit card, I was skeptical about providing such sensitive information. Regrettably, my decision to test the system by entering \"123456789\" led to me being locked out of my Apple Cash account.Desperate to resolve the issue, I reached out to Apple Support earlier today, where I spoke with Richard and his supervisor, Alicia. To my disappointment, they informed me that I had been suspended from using Apple Pay, and there was no apparent way to lift this suspension. Furthermore, I learned that I couldn‚Äôt create a new account without using my social security number, a requirement that Apple strictly enforces.I\\'ve noticed a concerning decline in the overall quality of Apple\\'s products and services. iPhones, which were once known for their reliability and innovation, appear to have lost their charm. Similarly, the experience with Apple\\'s services has deteriorated, as evident in my recent ordeal with Apple Cash. This has left me with a sense of dissatisfaction and frustration.Given the aforementioned issues, I\\'ve made the difficult decision to discontinue my use of Apple services and to part with all Apple products I own, including my iPhone, iPad, MacBook, iMac, and Apple TV. It saddens me to take this step, as I have been a long-time Apple customer, but I feel it is necessary to protect my personal information and seek more reliable alternatives.I hope that my feedback can contribute to improving the experiences of other Apple users in the future.

I called support and the tech walked me through the exact same steps I‚Äôd already done at the Apple Store then was at a loss and had to escalate it to a senior tech. 35 minutes later I finally got the Activation Lock removed.

I said I don‚Äôt know how the microphone was damaged but that had nothing to do with my display not working so could they just fix that??  Nope.  The ‚Äúaccidental damage‚Äù to the microphone voided the warranty so it was $399.00 or nothing would be done.

To my astonishment, the employee who checked me in informed me that the screen protector they sell in-store, which they can install, is different from the one I had purchased online. He stated that they couldn't install the one I bought online. This came as a complete surprise, and I asked him what could be done. He suggested they would refund my online purchase and provide me with the in-store screen protector, which they could install. I found it odd that this information was not conveyed online during my purchase, but I agreed to the change.However, what followed was a wait of an excruciating one hour with no progress. I complained multiple times to both the initial employee and other team members, but they repeatedly apologized and asked me to wait. When I arrived at the store, the queue only consisted of me and two others, and when I left, it was still just a few more customers waiting. Meanwhile, I observed many other customers buying phones and getting their screen protectors installed on the spot. My frustration reached its limit, and I demanded my order without the installation. Again, I was asked to wait. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, my order was handed over.To my disbelief, I noticed an installer standing idle for more than 10 minutes after I had received my order. I approached him, hoping to purchase a new screen protector and have it installed, but he informed me that I would have to wait another 20-30 minutes. I couldn't comprehend this, as I had already waited for an hour. He insisted that he had other customers to attend to. This was beyond frustrating.I escalated the issue to the manager, but to my dismay, he echoed the same response. This level of disrespect is utterly unacceptable.

Reality check so big needed that it doesn't exist.Couldn't make it up.Apple - a brand that sunk the amoral abyss of capitalism gone so horribly wrong - even lower.They don't care you've spent your time, your money, your sanity, your everything on days trying to work out what on god's earth is going on with their chaotic and ridiculous delivery system (they don't have one; they are so tight they allocate the courier company the night before - they are clearly waiting on the cheapest deals on delivery) - they really couldn't give a damn about the consumer. And their blatant hubris and ****-off attitude shows they're actually quite proud of their lack of any self awareness whatsoever.A so called senior complaints manager actually suggested there was something amiss with my attitude - to raise the subject of 50's style housewife ambitions from Apple's desire for money money money - it's cheaper for them that way of course....But she wants to tell me off for telling the truth; not a comfortable concept - the truth - for Apple. They like to talk down and boy do they go far with that premise that you're the dumbo and tell you off they will, talking over you and threatening to end calls - over - the truth.Have the customer held to ransom while they spend less on efficient and commensurate delivery. She also suggested that the customers' purchasing didn't pay for either staff  nor for Apple's existence.... :) No, sure, the fairy rainbow unicorns pay salaries. The fairy rainbow unicorns are - however - certainly in charge of deliveries - if you chase them for hours, over days.....Hubris beyond belief; of course you're expected to take a day off work, of course you're expected to wait ON US - we are the MIGHTY APPLE. Sit down and shut up little woman - was my lot. By a woman. #shameThey employ a company just to deal with complaints. Not entirely convinced it's the right one. My lost working day and hours spent on chasing up the order are - she agrees - worthy of invoicing. 'They won't care' are her final words on the complaint I raise. In writing, and email over while I am on the 'phone to her.\", \"Punished for not owning an Apple Device anymore!!To reset your password without your old Apple devices you require access to your phone, Email, Credit card details, and then you have to wait 48 Hours for them to confirm your Identity! If someone has access to all of this information and accounts, not even apple would be able to tell if it's actually me! If you have an aPpLe device on the other hand (I saw a video of a step by step guide) you are always just a few clicks away from resetting your password.This is exactly the reason I sold my Apple devices: the constant abuse of power by the company; you are reminded that you don't own your Account, they own you. And if you don't pay enough, they will go out of their way to make your life more complicated.\", 'The device constantly slows down, loses connection to the internet or shows us a spinning ‚Äòlack of progress‚Äô wheel.Our BT connection is certainly poor (North London), but:If we go to Safari and erase our browser history (advanced) - the list of ‚Äòcookies‚Äô is genuinely shocking,  often you can scroll down for a couple of pages worth,  even though we ALWAYS say ‚ÄòNO‚Äô or ‚ÄòREJECT‚Äô - then everything returns to normal, so it ISN‚ÄôT an indifferent internet signal OR that it is a busy time of day‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶..it is that the device accepts cookies, whether we want them or not (and we really, really DON‚ÄôT), and these are responsible for the frankly DREADFUL performance of what is an expensive, premium device. Whatever they are doing is drawing power, tying-up the processor and rendering the device unusable, which, if you really stop to think about it, is absolutely outrageous. All the privacy settings are set to ‚Äòdeny access‚Äô, refuse cookies, prevent tracking etc etcApple electronics and software DO NOT prevent this, DO NOT protect us, but instead allow - wave through? - all kinds of malign material.Our conclusion is either: Apple is incompetent‚Ä¶.. ‚Ä¶has been hacked or circumvented or bypassed in some way (back door?)‚Ä¶..OR: That this is the way Apple wants it.Either way, we observe that each subsequent generation of the iPad (and this is our fourth) is quite noticeably worse in this respect and that, far from knuckling under and just accepting it, even our son is now almost looking forward to the moment when all this becomes unbearable so that we can finally dispense with the damned thing altogether and simply not bother at all.Apple. It was a mistake to bite into it.', 'I used my credit card with apple they charged me near to $2000 without me knowing. I know it was my fault I should have checked my visa but I trusted them to be honest and helpful. But instead they abused my information and broke my trust.

Fast forward 2 weeks, my warranty had expired and I was extremely worried. I spoke to a representative, who passed me to their manager. They cancelled the original order and sent a new box to me.

He should have been moved to the front of the line because of the level of urgency.I sincerely hope nothing happens to him during the night.Now I have to again bring him to the store, which is 20 minutes away. Customer service could care less, nor did they even seem to comprehend the texts I was sending them explaining the situation.

It prevents me from doing my job while at work and it prevents me from enjoying it when I'm not. What worries me the most is if I had a 911 emergency I would have to be lucky enough for it to happen while the phone is operational.

My kids all have iPad Airs. We all love all of our Apple gadgets. Yes, it has cost me a lot of money. A smarter person would probably hit the brakes on buying all of it, but we are all huge fans, and oh, well! Love it.Twice in the past I was disappointed with Apple. It was prior to my moving only to SSD models. I won\\'t rehash it. I went back to Windows and Android for several years, but then the siren song called me again and here we are.It\\'s pricey, but the technology is fantastic.

The cause is a well known desing flaw with the screen conector, just google ‚Äúmbp flexgate problem‚Äù. Apple has given some coverture on this problem to buyers of the 2016 version, but none at all to buyers, like me, of the 2017 version. If you own this computer and it suffers from the flexgate problem, with time all the screen will probably go black, as mine did last week. The only solution offered by Apple is to pay them $600+ for the repair. Yes, expensive for a connector‚Ä¶ the explanation is elsewhere in the web, again a bad design decission.

Matters that seem to be relatively simple and straight forward when dealing with any other business, from a startup small business on up to a Fortune 500 company, are apparently very difficult or impossible for Apple to accomplish.It appears that Apple is not familiar with elements of modern technology, specifically in regards to how to give and receive phone calls or communications over the internet.Of all of the companies I have dealt with for the past decade or so, the company which has shown itself to be the most technically challenged and behind-the-times in the fields of internet technology and telecommunications, is Apple, Inc.Specifically:1. I signed up online for an Apple developer account, which was the first step to getting a payment processing account.2. I then received an email stating that the application could not be completed without a phone call.  This is a dated technology (phone communications). Such dated technology is not usually needed by modern corporations familiar with 21st internet technologies used for long distance communications.  Even in the case where a face-to-face meeting is desired for verification purposes, we have numerous methods of accomplishing this which are far more advanced than telephones.3. Nevertheless, I set aside a time to call Apple, despite recognizing that this company is behind the times.4. When I attempted to contact Apple, I found that they had other issues.  There is no phone number to call.  The only way to contact them is to go online and submit a request for them to contact me.5. Despite this outdated technology and hassle, I input my phone number and waited for their call.6. I attempted this numerous times. On some occasions, my phone rang but when I answered and responded, I heard only silence.  On other occasions, the phone did not ring at all and I then received an email that Apple was \"trying to reach me.\"  7. I contacted Apple by email and requested to have their phone number so that I could call them, since they were not able to call me.8. Apple support then told me that they do not have a phone number to receive calls.  (Another indicator that this company is about 100 years behind modern times: they are demanding a phone call, but have no number.)9. I again made an appointment for Apple to call me.10. I arranged my schedule and made myself available for the call.  Again, the same pattern repeated. On some occasions, the phone rang, I picked up and answered, and heard silence.  On other occasions, the phone did not ring at all and I got an email saying \"we\\'re trying to reach you.\"11. I made another appointment.  I gave another number. I waited for the call.  The phone was sitting by me and did not ring.  There was no missed call. I received an email from Apple, stating that they had called and could not get through.I can see that Apple, Inc. is at least a few decades out of date.  It should probably get itself up to speed with modern technologies, such as how to use a telephone, and what internet technology is.  I am able to work with any other business, whether it is a bank or an ice cream shop.

I called multiple times only to be told to wait 2-3 days every single time. They finally contacted me to note that there isn‚Äôt a payment card on the system to pay for the excess charge. They made out that it was my fault for this however, there wasn‚Äôt a single time in the claim process that I was asked for this information until that point. Do not purchase apple care. I had to buy a replacement phone in this process and keep returning every 14 days as per policy. Ok my third purchase, the apple agent stated I had an additional 2 months to return the phone as they have extended the returns policy (November 2022). When I tried to return they then stated that this was untrue information. I am now stuck with 2 devalued phones. Ridiculous how apple have handled this whole situation. I advise you to avoid this company at all costs.', 'Apple is cool and I love how they track everywhere I go because then I know how long I‚Äôve been dealing drugs downtown and when to go back to my house behind the dumpster.', 'I cannot sign into my Apple ID because of ‚Äútwo-factor authentication‚Äù I don‚Äôt have access to any of my the old numbers connected to my Apple ID and I called and asked what Apple could do to help me and there was nothing they could do.

It‚Äôs not like I forgot my Apple ID and password because I didn‚Äôt... it‚Äôs the fact that they want me to get a code from an old number that I haven‚Äôt used in years and don‚Äôt have access to. Why should I have to do that?', \"had an issue with my password not working and called Apple to get it resolved.  I repeatedly got hung up on when I pointed out that the representatives were not listening to the problem or the fact that I had already tried all the normal steps.  When I finally was transferred to '3rd' level customer support and had to repeat everything again twice, I was told that I need to erase my system and did not even try to resolve it any other way.  The lady did not even suggest that I try to reinstall the OS.  She didn't even know whether the reinstall would erase the data that was there or not.  I asked how I could get the data off the drive first, she suggested that I could call a data recovery service.  I spoke to a few more '3rd' level techs, all of which knew less about the OS than I did.  None wanted to take responsibility for their lack of knowledge and simply find someone to help me properly.  I can and did simply go to the web and find out how to simply copy the data.  Sure, I could have gone to a data recovery service and paid $100-$500 to do this for me, but why?  I can easily follow directions about using Terminal and do it with a few simple commands, but none of them would help me find the commands.  All they really needed to do was point me to the right place on Apple's website to do so or have someone knowledgeable give me the commands.  While, I don't know linux, I do know a bit about programming, so it was not an issue with just a few bits of information.  Something that could have been easily handled with a real technical support, was mismanaged from every encounter.  The error was based an issue with their operating system and no one would take responsibility for that and find and real resolution.  I even pointed out that the password work for the recovery, just not in the normal sign in mode, which goes to prove the issue was the OS.  Furthermore, I could see the files and therefore there was no need to erase and could easily be copied.  Not having an option to reach someone beyond individuals who had very low level training beyond reading a script caused high anxiety and only resulted in bad suggestions.\", 'Love the service.

Apple refused repair even after their agent confirmed it should be covered. Experienced poor support direct with Apple support and service to a known problem with AirPods Pro (1sr Gen). Manufacturer fault with product not covered after 3 years of ownership even though a know fault of the batch, in my case very low use of the product so took longer to appear. Senior Manager did not take ownership or provide customer service and responsibility commensurate to level of a premier manufacturer for a long standing customers loyalty. Very disappointed with product quality or durability due to low usage of the item as explained, senior manager had no care or compassion towards the customer which was a polar opposite from the initial agent. This attitude and abruptness demonstrated contempt for the end users and lack of vision to future sales for Apple. I certainly am now thinking the product is not fit for purpose or high value status, if the AirPods  products are not durable for limited use like myself and not supported then no point to utilising Apple products in the future. I would like to state the Senior manager dealing at the end of my call certainly didn‚Äôt value customers and would question his capability.

All efforts to rectify this became a pain in the bum because my kids so stressed me out to fix it.

I popped into 02 Store in Woolwich and asked for Apple IPAD chargers. The agent told me both chargers would set me aback by ¬£48. I screamed because I had been used to buying roadside chargers for ¬£10 max, which stopped working a week after. I took the risk and bought both chargers for ¬£48 and for the next 7 months, I had respite from my kids - no more charger challenge anymore, until recently when both chargers stopped working and all hell was let lose. My kids are so used to their IPADs the way I am so used to my smart phone. So I know what they are going through each time they can't get their IPAD to work. I went back to the 02 store for warranty replacement and was told to contact Apple directly. I did and Apple fixed an appointment for me to pop into their nearest store at Stratford to get the items replaced. I visited apple Stratford and got both chargers replaced, bran new without any questions.At Apple shop Stratford, I was not only wowed by their excellent customer service amidst a huge endless crowd, I was bowled over by Apples display of a vast array of 21st century gadgets, ranging from smart iPhones to tablets and PCs.And I remembered Steve Jobs of blessed memory and his subsisting legacy, the Apple brand. May he continue to RIP. I advise all and sundry, should you ever wish to purchase, any smart phones, tablets and PCs, please go to Apple for quality, and after care service. Because you have purchased from Apple, (any product, even outside waranty) Apple will continue to look after you and that product for life. Eg 2 IPADs (8 generation- 2020) I bought for my kids at the cost of ¬£450 each... Even when it was outside warranty when my younger daughter (8yr old) had her screen broken, Apple offered me same product, bran new replacement at the cost of ¬£200 (which I considered to be a very ridiculous PRIZE).No seller out there will do similar.Hence I said if you must buy any smart phones, tablet or PCs, for Quality and your own peace of mind, pls buy ONLY from Apple cos Apple will look after u and your product for life...

Great saving and perfect quality\", \"Having been a customer of Apple for many years, I could simply never go back to using Windows/Android again. Apple is just so much easier - from the purchase experience to everyday usage, to support and find suitable replacements when necessary. Customer service over the phone is honestly the best I've probably received from any company and the in-store experience reflects this, staff are always very attentive and go above and beyond to answer your question or find you the best product. iCloud is an amazing service and really simplifies cloud storage, Apple Music is very simple and the quality of the music sound itself is great, Apple TV+ has a limited selection of shows although what is on offer is of outstanding quality and is far better than Netflix/Disney+/Amazon and Arcade is also packed full of free great games which are all ad-free. Apple really know what a good purchase experience is like, bought many products over the years from their stores and the staff are dedicated to answering any questions you have, and from what I've experienced, tell you the truth and don't oversell your products you don't need. For example, I was advised by a staff member to go for an iPhone 14 Plus instead of the iPhone 14 Pro Max as I didn't require the extra features, which now I totally agree with and saved me hundreds of pounds. Macs are of really great quality and so much easier to use than Windows, little things you take for granted which aren't available on Windows or are much harder to use. HomePod Mini packs a punch and is an incredibly good value at only ¬£89, far better than Alexa and I'd even compare them to Sonos at double the price. Similar experience with AirPods. Apple Watch is a great little accessory which allows you to not just have a 'mini phone on your wrist', but also show a little bit of your personality and I love the pride watch straps. After-sales service is simply outstanding, had an issue with an iPhone just outside of warranty, took it to my local Apple Store and was repaired for free. Phone staff are really helpful and opening hours are impressive, even had an issue with HomePod on Christmas Day resolved very quickly and efficiently. Really recommend Apple all around, and will never look back.\", 'This company is going down the toilet.', 'One of the most disappointing downfalls of a company.

I  explained I was exempt from wearing a face covering. He said I would have to wear either a mask or visor. Again I explained I was exempt from wearing any covering on my face.The advisor said that if I did not wear a facecovering I would not be allowed in store to make my purchase.  This is against the law which clearly shows on the Government website and states. To insist that I disclose why is a breach of section 29 (5) (a) of the Equality Act 2010. To deny me entry and/or service is a breach of section 13 (1) of the Equality Act 2010. Not all disabilities are visible. The advisor knew nothing of my reasons he was just intent on being very rude to me.

The issue is that all the configurations, progress and additions made to these apps will be gone. It's fu***** madness! Every other account I have updated where this kind of issue arose was fixable because the company concerned sent an email with a link in it that I could use to reset the login/password/security question/whatever. Apple however are fanatical fundamentalists who consider that if you cannot answer a fifteen year old question then you are not who you say you are. End of story.

This is a huge issue for me being in sales. I called and the first person from India was very helpful and showed me how to turn it off. I am writing a one-star review however for the following: Turning off the feature that transcribes voicemails into text also turned off the microphone on Whatsapp, messenger and text messages. That is a really inept software design issue. If someone wants to turn off transcription of voicemails into text so that they come thru faster, why would it also be tied to being able to use the microphone for voice to text on Whatsapp, messenger and messages? Those are two entirely different things.  The second issue and main reason for the one-star review is the second Apple advisor I got when I called back. This hasn\\'t been the first time I called and got a fanatical, almost Nazi Zealot Zombie type advisor that wouldn\\'t listen to me and what I was asking and saying and just kept saying the microphone issue was due to my iPhone being one software update behind and not due to the feature the other advisor had me turn off just ten minutes prior. I kept asking if there was a work around to keep the microphone for texting on whilst turning off the voicemail to text feature and he kept being degrading asking me \" if my doctor told me to do something if I would do it\" and to do the software update. Then he hung up on me when I said I felt like he wasn\\'t listening and giving me bad service.  So, I hope Apple reads this.

I called the day I ordered this product in order to cancel the repair because I found my air pod‚Ä¶ The customer support contacted Senior management who said she would reach out to the carrier and stop the shipping on the product (Please pull the recording on this conversation, she never told me that I would need to refuse the package.) How can I refuse a packing that you never sent me a shipping email for, even after stating you would? The product was never in shipping mode as of Thursday the 27th. I assumed that the senior manager handled this. Until today June 1st, 2021, when I received the package when I got home. No one signed for it, they just left the package. (Hard to refuse something you don‚Äôt know is coming, let alone never receive a shipping email for). I thought the senior manager handled it. Well today I called and spoke to Trey, who basically told me there will be no refund, even after told by the other senior manager that I would receive a refund. No brand loyalty. I got told on two occasions to sell the product on ‚ÄòeBay‚Äô. So much for Apple loyalty. Why have loyal customers who buy from apple, when you‚Äôre sending them to EBAY? Trey the senior manager from today, was kind and apologized, but apologies does not stand by customer support and is inappropriate when there is zero resolve and will not let you speak to another person. As a customer who has spent nearly 10k on apple products in the last few years, I‚Äôm astonished in how you treat customers over $95. Customer service doesn‚Äôt matter to you, and brand loyalty must not be important if I can buy knock offs from EBAY and you support that. It‚Äôs very upsetting.

She had a gift card that I was using (with her permission), which limited the choices I had; most new iPads were more expensive, and I opted to try the Apple website that offered refurbished iPads.  Note that this was an official Apple website, not a third-party one.It was a terrible experience, and I would advise anyone to avoid using this site.  I first tried to order an 8th-generation iPad in Space Gray, the color my daughter preferred.  The item was shown as available on the website. The cost was acceptable given the amount of her gift card.  The order appeared to go through, but a day later, I was advised that the order was canceled.  I called Apple and was told that unfortunately the Space Gray was out of stock.  Worse, Apple had put a \"hold\" on the amount of the purchase, and I had to wait for that to clear before I could use the full amount of the gift card again.Forewarned by this experience, I first called Apple to check that the next color choice for this generation of iPad (silver) was in stock.  I was told it was.  Once the hold on the card cleared, I ordered the silver.  Apple accepted the order, and I received an email saying the order was \"in process\" and was projected to be delivered on a certain date.  That date passed without any progress on the order. I then received an email saying that THIS order was canceled.  I called Apple again and was told, again, that the color was out of stock.  Another \"hold\" was placed on the gift card and, as of 2 days after the cancellation, the hold is still in effect, preventing me from buying an iPad somewhere else.I have used Apple products for years and have been very happy with their design and functionality.  However, this experience has undermined my confidence that Apple cares about its customers.  This borders on improper consumer practices.True, my daughter has not lost any money - this would be consumer fraud - but the time and effort I\\'ve spent trying to buy a product that appeared to be available (or was confirmed to be available) on Apple\\'s website was completely wasted, and my daughter still does not have an iPad.Again, I advise you not to expect the Apple refurbished website to be reliable or able to fulfill your orders.', \"... the right products and excellent customer service in store.\\r The only problem here is the dubious factory conditions experienced by workers in China and elsewhere in Asia.

Sadly we arrived late after travelling 76 miles from mid Wales. We could not be seen for 15 minutes so we looked at the various iPads on display. When the sales person arrived, we explained that we wanted exactly the set up displayed. An iPad 10 instead of a 9 as my wife liked the keyboard with the 10. The salesman checked and said that there were no p8nk ones in stock. However, one could be sent to our home the next day.

Three times the phone hung up when trying to speak to someone. The fourth time, we had an answer and as we gave the order number, the line went dead again. We then tried three other numbers on Google, including the complaints number. All cut us off once we started giving the information. We then tried one of the numbers again and actually managed to speak to someone. We had to ask for them to speak louder as we could barely hear them. Also, it was extremely difficult to understand the lady. We were then told that our address was wrong despite us giving them our address and the parcel arriving. We spelled out the details and strangely, our address was right. We were eventually told that we had only bought the iPad. We had stressed that the package on display was exactly what we needed. We eventually asked for them to collect the package as it was of no value without the keyboard. She explained that it would cost another two hundred pounds for the keyboard. She then put us through to someone else as she was an engineer. Eventually, it was agreed for Apple to send us labels and we would arrange it collected from our home. We would have to wait until the item reached their factory and was checked before any refund. This would take another 3-5 days to refund. Terrible service all round. They had offered for us to go back to the store to buy a keyboard. This would only have been another 150 miles round trip.

After another few days of waiting with no updates, I called and after getting the runaround for 2 hours (!!), I finally learned that the return address could not be changed.  What a huge waste of time.  Since I would not be flying back just to pick up my laptop, I just canceled the repair.

I called Apple technical support and was given 3 other data recovery companies. I tried again without any success. By looking up from Internet for more information, I can see quite a few people had these problems before. But very strange that they did not talk too much after raising this issue. I summarise all my findings here:1. iPhone iOS has a bug in its Notes which can automatic remove locally stored data even you have upgrade to iOS16. Or maybe hardware storage is not stable (that may be dangerous to other data storage!)2. iPhone Notes locally stored data lost cannot be recovered by any methods.3. Apple cannot help at all and they don‚Äôt acknowledge this bug and they don‚Äôt want to take any responsibility to the data lost4.

I did not learn this until recently that the hard drive is attached to the logic board on the new laptops and all housed together. But why would they keep the old part(s) and not send it back to me, the customer and rightful owner of the part, nor tell me why?

They certainly never provided me those details. Not to mention, what did the \"authorized Apple repair center\" do with my old logic board/hard drive?? That hard drive contained sensitive financial and personal data on it, so why not tell the customer what happens to their old parts, especially parts that house sensitive data?? I did contact Apple support and they basically said once you sign off to have the repair done, they get to keep your old part(s) and erase your data and never give any details as to what really happened or what went wrong!

Here goes my story with them. I financed an Apple 13 pro and I got Apple Care+ with Theft and Loss which should cover your phone if it is lost. While traveling we were put to sleep and robbed at our Airbnb and our phones were stolen. When I tried to log in to my account, my phone was put into something that Apple calls \"Recovery Mode\" and they cut my access from my account for 18 days because people who stole it, tried to get into the phone and for security reasons, Apple put my account on such a long non-sense hold. After the 18 days was over, I logged into my account and my device was not showing under my account. Of course the thieves were not sitting around for me to log in and find their location. They either jalbroke my phone, or they took it into pieces and used the hardware. Here is Apple\\'s loophole. In order to file a lost phone claim, I have to log into my account and put the phone in \"Lost Mode\" but this is not an option because for no reason my phone had disappeared and does not show on my account. How is that under my control? They are saying that I might have turn the \"Find My Phone\" option off which I never did. The funny fact is that when you turn that off, Apple sends you an email that the option was turned off. I never received that email and Apple knows that because they keep the record of everything in their system. In the end, Apple is telling me to go F*** myself because of their loophole I cant file a claim and the $1200 phone is gone. What is the point of getting insurance? I am switching from Apple after more than 10 years because their customer service and their ethics of business are disgusting. Apple gave 18 days to the thieves to do whatever they want so I have to go back and buy another phone from them. So unfair, so wrong. The fact is that I have insurance and my phone is stolen from me and the insurance has to cover it. Now the way to file is defined by Apple in a way for them to benefit from this. My case simply has to be filed manually because it is an error on Apple\\'s system for not showing my device.', \"I called for support to try and get my new printer, HP Smart Tank 5100, hooked up to my wifi and Imac computer where it wasn't working.

I learned only in 2020 (not from Apple contacting me upfront, but from being contacted by an attorney associated with a class action settlement) that my computer was covered under the terms of a repair program to address a design flaw with the \"butterfly keyboard\" that caused keys to become stuck and/or unresponsive (Apple has since discontinued the butterfly keyboard for this reason). I then called Apple Support, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, and confirmed that my computer\\'s serial number was among those covered. I requested a mail in repair, but was told that I needed to bring it into the store because the repair was not eligible for shipping. I said I was not willing to take it to the store at the risk of my health (this was still pre-vaccine, when nearly everyone was doing their best to stay inside), and so I offered to pay the cost of shipping. I was told I still could not do this, and needed to take it into the store. This made me feel like Apple was adopting a tactic to reduce the likelihood of people actually getting their repair done -- and therefore, to reduce Apple\\'s costs -- which bothered me and reduced my trust in Apple. However, I was told on that same phone call that because my device was covered, I was covered in perpetuity and could bring my device in for repair in the future whenever I felt comfortable doing so. So I accepted the situation, and decided to wait until the Covid emergency was declared over to bring it in again.Fast forward to today, June 27, 2023, less than two months after the federal government declared an end to the pandemic emergency (May 5). I took my computer to the Apple Store in St. Louis Galleria to get the faulty keyboard fixed, and after hearing my problem, the \"genius\" pulled up an Apple website and told that me the program had ended and that my computer could no longer be fixed. I explained the circumstances above -- that I had been promised a fix at whatever point I felt comfortable, and that the problem itself was the result of acknowledged faulty design by Apple -- and asked that an exception be made to cover the repair. They told me at the Apple Store that they could not (Genius bar manager) and would not (store manager) make an exception, and told me Customer Support could. I called Customer Support this evening, spoke to a senior advisor, explained the situation, and he, too, told me that not only could he not make an exception, he could not refer me to anyone who could, and that the repair would not be covered under any circumstances.I have been buying Apple products only for nearly 25 years. When I got married, I started buying them for my wife. When I had a child, I started buying them for my daughter. Over this time, I have seen the quality of Apple products decline and its \"it just works\" software become less functional and intuitive, but I have stuck with Apple because of brand loyalty and because Apple has generally fixed problems in good faith when something went wrong. In this case, that good faith has disappeared and been replaced by what I consider cynical bad faith, with several levels of Apple employees providing wrong information and refusing (or being unable) to take accountability and initiative for a product that was flawed upon purchase, and which the company had already committed to fix at my convenience.The bottom line is that I\\'m stuck with a broken computer that was doomed to fail when I first took it out of the box. If this sounds fair to you, by all means buy Apple, as I have for a quarter century. If not, join me in buying elsewhere, as I plan to do from here on out.', 'Apple are turning into Microsoft, in the last two weeks I‚Äôve had issues with a brand new MacBook Pro, two pairs of IPods and now my phone has updated and lost all my personal settings and they can‚Äôt fix any of it.

Great customer service', \"I'm surprised that there are so many negative comments about customer service. I've been purchasing Apple and Windows products for 15 years and Apple have always treated me well. I had a Sony Vaio that was constantly plagued with problems (wifi, keyboard, screen, battery, trackpad) and would spend 8 weeks at a time being serviced by Sony (thats how long it took them to repair any issue I had). Since these issues didnt all arise at once I would send it in for repair and wait 2 months to get it back only to have used it for a few days until a new issue would pop up and the cycle repeated. I ended up shoving the laptop at the back of my closet in frustration and Sony would go on to cease making laptops altogether. My next purchase was a 13 inch Macbook Pro in 2017 that served me well over the years with no issues until recently. One was the problematic keyboard that many complained about (thankfully the new 2020 models don't have this issue any more). The second problem I had was with the screen. In an act of rage i slammed the lid on my Macbook with great force because of some bad news I received and the screen went completely black and would'nt turn on. My Macbook was just out of warranty and I was worried it would cost me a fortune to fix. I took it in to the Apple store in Chatswood for repair and they replaced my keyboard for free and they replaced my screen and didn't charge me for the parts (which is not cheap and can cost anywhere between $400-$1200 for a new screen). Apple only charged me $149 for the service fee. Since my warranty was void Apple could have charged me for every piece i needed repaired if they wanted to. However, they were kind enough to supply the parts free and only charge me the service fee. This goes to show that Apple does really care about customer satisfaction.

I wanted to reset my password (for most companies it is a straight forward job but not for all mighty Apple), to encounter a huge problem. They asked me to submit all via email and phone message (they emailed me and sent me a text to enter code, which I did), I punched their both codes to prove it is me and not a thief then they treated me as a thief. They said they will get in touch within 24h with further details. They did get in touch within 24h (on the 24h hour rather than a second earlier) only to say they will either call me or text me on 7 October to re-set my password. I was in shock. When I rang I was told they do not have enough date on me (I used to have Apple products from iPhone to Mac Pro but chose to switch to Samsung), hence I have to wait to reset my password. In this age and date one would think it is much easier to deal with anything, a question to Apple is, how much more data will you have for me on 7 October if you did not have enough now in order to re set my password. Imagine if  I was in need of  more complex issue!!! With such behaviour they put me off to purchase their new IPhone 14 pro and IPad, instead I will opt for Samsung 22 and 23 later on. They have way much better customer service and certainly do not need 3 weeks to re set password. Especially if they check your identity via your phone and email at the same time. Insane. When Steve Jobs left the company over the issue with their then management, the Apple went down. It is the same issue now. Most people employed by Apple now would be long gone if Steve Jobs was at the helm of the company.', 'I am giving you 1 star because I cannot give you 0. What a nightmare! There is a chaos with the apple account that nobody seems to be able to solve. I have already spoken with two customer assistants for HOURS on the phone, I am talking to a manager, Ilay, however you write it, right now but he apparently can\\'t solve the problem either. The original problem was that I keep on getting this pop up saying that I have a virus. More than two hours afterwards, we had to change both the passwords of my laptop and Apple ID. We managed to change the one for my laptop but my Apple ID was unsuccessful. And then is when the true nightmare began.I went to the shop directly and spoke to the \"Genius\" technician. At some point I know that he changed some password somewhere, I don\\'t know where or why, but he put apple just as the password somewhere, and he left it at that. I WASTED all Sunday in the shop, but I couldn\\'t stay there for so long, oh no. Apple doesn\\'t want frustrated and unhappy customers in the shop-they might put off other customers. Of course not, even when they are being absolutely incompetent at problems they created. So I had to spend one hour waiting in the mall doing nothing until I could come back so that the guy tried to recover the password once again. By the way, while this Genius guy was at it, he changed all the settings: no alarms for some reason, the light on my screen turned off for some reason, so I had to call AGAIN so that another person helped me to put everything right again. Anyway, it didn\\'t work again, so I had to wait almost a month to get a six digit thing sent to my phone and recover my apple account. Did it work today? Oh, no. Of course not. So I called again customer services. Somebody called Ilay who said he was a manager was giving me instructions, but half the time I didn\\'t even know what password he was talking about, what he was describing. The guy looked bored as hell, but I was not bored, I was angry and upset. In the end he was no help at all and clueless. He is puzzled why the system keeps on asking me for a password of a different computer that I never had. So I cannot have any updates, so my personal and banking data is going to be at risk more and more. This is my first computer and I can tell you right now that is going to be the last.In the end, according to this guy, it\\'s all my fault, because I don\\'t know all my previous passwords. Who is going to remember old, changed passwords? What am I supposed to remember those? When you change passwords, the old ones get invalidated. But not with Apple, and somehow this is all my fault, according to Manager Ilya that has not helped at all. But not with Apple. They wanted me to remember old passwords to see if one of them works. Meanwhile, there is no solution: I am still being pestered with virus warnings and the what not, I cannot get updates, the system is asking me for passwords for \\'the other computer\\' that doesn\\'t exist and never existed and Apple couldn\\'t care less. If anybody is thinking about changing to an apple phone or laptop, I would recommend them to stick with Windows. I more than two decades with Windows I never had such a problem with them, maybe with the cheap HP laptops I used to buy, but not with Windows. STICK WITH WINDOWS, FOLKS!!!

After just TWENTY months, it died completely for no apparent reason. I turned it on to be met with a black screen. I reset it by tapping the volume keys and then holding to the top button, and the Apple logo appeared, all blurred. Nothing I do revives it. I cannot believe this has happened, it just demonstrates that Apple product is simply not fit for purpose, and if anyone thinks that they\\'re safer buying Apple as a trusted brand, they could not be more wrong.

Sorry!? My computer looks like a tarantula with external extensions sticking out all over the place. Really handy when you need to quickly put the laptop in your bag, because yes it is a laptop. No?Has the product been tested? If yes. By who?How do I charge my iPhone? How do I insert the memory card of my pro camera? No question ...This product is a shame! Because when you see the competitive market. Where is Apple? We expect from this luxury product a minimum of functionality at the height of its Design. Isn\\'t that the minimum? What to simplify our life?I always buy Apple, but I had to write all of these points because it\\'s really making fun of the consumer:- Very nice closed object, the coating of which still leaves far too many traces and fingerprints. A square of fabric suitable for the maintenance of this luxury product should be provided.- Screen light adaptation is not subtle enough. It goes through shades of green, red, blue and yellow every second. It‚Äôs disturbing when you are working. The variation is poorly managed.- The fixed front icon of \"managing windows open in the background\", in my opinion the most useful tool, has disappeared. You have to go look for it in the touchscreen sidebar- The tactile sidebar is too small for the fingers (I am female). It‚Äôs a genuinely useless, time-wasting gadget. It‚Äôs really giving crumbs when Apple can do better than that. In this case, the entire keyboard should be tactile, including the customisable sidebar (example: touch bar for managing ‚Äúfixed icon‚Äù windows).The touchscreen should be a highlight expected in 2021, for an Apple product with the integrated 3D option, justifying the price.Thank you', \"Rude staff make it impossible for you to repair the phone and they don't care about retrieving your data, they don't care for you.

On Thursday July 8, 2021 I was working outside most of the day with both phones in my pocket. Raleigh, NC was experiencing heavy rains due to a tropical storm. On Friday night, 7/9/21, the display on the iPhone 12 went out. Went online and made an appointment at an Apple store for 7/10/21. The agent determined that it was water damage and offered the following solutions: 1) pay $449 for a repair/replacement. 2) buy a new phone starting at $399 and up based on various models. 3) pay $449 for a replacement iPhone 12 and then add 2 year warranty for $199 with a $99 deductible. However, even though I would be getting a new iPhone 12, the warranty would be retroactive to the original date of October 2020. If I spent $449 for a new iPhone and compared extended warranty to no extended warranty it would be like this if I had another incident with water damage:Warranty: 15 months coverage (now thru Oct 2022) $199 + $99 deductible = $298No warranty: $449 for replacement iPhone My argument was that the iPhone 12 has a higher water resistance rating than does the iPhone 8. In addition, the water resistance decreases over time. The iPhone 8 is several years old and the iPhone 12 is less than a year old. Yet, both phones were exposed to the rain storm while in my pocket. The iPhone 8 is still working and the iPhone 12 is not. The Apple agent stated that Apple does not get into the reasons or circumstances of how the water damage occurred, only that there is water damage and therefore it is not covered under their warranty. My counter that it appears that there was a manufacturing defect since the higher rated iPhone 12 was not as water resistant as the much older iPhone 8 was met with Apple policy of water damage = no warranty and no chance of manufacturing defect ever.', \"I was on the phone with one of the senior advisors.

It is much more fluent to use, and is far more stable than all PCs I have ever had (a couple of them high-end).Also; (I have the old kind of Macbook Air still) it has a build quality I have never encountered in any PC, and (actually the number 1 thing I look for in computers) it is completely silent 95% of the time, which is worth a lot to me.So yeah, I do think some famous brands are overvalued, but Apple (at least their computers - the only product of theirs I have used) is not one of them.', 'if I could give it a non-star i willlong short story I will need to write a book  about the negative thing about that ASSHOLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES ATTENDANT', 'Have iPhone 12 Pro have 2 small yellow dots on the screen, phoned customer support, was told I was to late by a week, despite reporting it earlier due to covid was not able to get to a service Center They did not care Then in the last few months my MacBook keyboard has stopped working have to press really hard on the keys if I‚Äôm lucky it works, then one of the usbC ports stopped working So basically ¬£2800 of apple products seriously faulty I‚Äôm done with apple been a customer since the original iPhone and have gone back to windows for music production and work and will purchase an android phone soon Overpriced unreliable garbage', 'Right now, there are 4 series of airpods which are made by Apple. The Airpods (1st generation) released in 2016, Airpods (2nd generation) released in 2019, Airpods Pro released in 2019 and Airpods Max released in 2020. Mostly all of these are approximately priced more than 150$ and can be up to 549$ with the latest series. From my perspective, I didn‚Äôt use other airpods here the reasons why.Firstly, the airpods 1 have no active noise cancellation, which means outside noise may interfere with user listening experiences. Short battery life around 5 hours of listening time and 2 hours of talking time for 1 single charge, this may not be enough for some users. Airpods 1 might work well with Apple devices, they may not work well with other brand devices, and some features might be limited or not available at all. Additionally, some users have reported that there are connection issues with older system devices. Secondly, the airpods 2 lack water resistance, which means they can be damaged internally by water splashes, sweat and rain. Airpods 2 don‚Äôt have active noise cancellation. Also short battery life around 5 hours if listening time and 3 hours of talking time on single charge.Lastly, The AirPods Max are one of the most expensive headphones on the overall headphone market. It is very bulky and heavy to carry around. The Airpods Max are heavier and bulkier than other popular headphones, which make the users feel uncomfortable wearing them for many hours. There is no power-off button on Airpods Max, which means they are always in a low-power battery mode, even when they are not in use. This makes the battery life feel shorter for some users. Lastly, airpods max do not support lossless audio, which means you may not be able to enjoy highest quality audio files. I have been using airpods pro for approximately 3 years now. The reasons why I bought airpods pro are active noise cancellation, comfortable carrying around and better compatibility with ios and other devices. The ios make the airpods pro easy to connect to other apple devices. The battery life is acceptable, the battery of the airpods pro lasts about 4.5 hours with active noise cancellation turned on. It can also connect and be compatible with other devices with bluetooth.However, there are some flaws. After using it for many years, the microphone doesn‚Äôt work for me anymore. When I use it for phone calls I need to change to the original microphone instead of using the airpods microphone. The earbuds are also damaged and worn out making the sound not contained in the ear also making the noise cancellation  doesn‚Äôt work. Later, when I figured out that I needed to buy new earbuds, I found out that Apple only gives me 1 pair of each earbud size (small, medium, and large). I decided to buy new earbuds from another brand because apple earbuds are really expensive.As a result, I think that Apple Airpods pro is the best series compared to the other series. It might not be affordable for everyone, however I think it is totally worth it if you want to buy new wireless headphones.', 'I have lost faith in Apple and will never buy another product from them.

I started with a Power Mac G5, which was robust and fast, it still works but is used now as a giant storage device. The cracks in Apple began to appear when they refused to support older tech like this, but I carried on with them because of the quality in customer service and cutting edge technology. I know how to take iPhones apart and fix them up etc. So, my list of mostly obsolete Apple products is: G5, MacBook Air Pro, iPhones 3,4,5,6 iPads x 2. 100gb cloud storage.

When I received my invoice, though, I noticed the support date ended two years from the purchase date - not the 3 years I had been told via phone.This was when my ordeal began.I went to the support site and tried calling them, and after waiting for several minutes and the call not being picked up, it got disconnected. Strangely enough, when my intention was to make a purchase, customer support not only answered my calls immediately, but they even called me back within 5 minutes.I scheduled a support call (mind you, this was right after the purchase) and on my chosen date, I got no call.Fast forward a few months and numerous attempts to contact support again, and I still had no luck.One year later, after many failed calls and being blatantly ignored (scheduled calls, attempted calls from my part) I decided to contact US support. I got an immediate reply via chat, however, wrong country, so no one could answer why my Apple Care + was 2 years instead of 3. Great.On 2021, the 2 year extra support ends and lo and behold, my touchbar decides to stop working.After a few more attempts to contact or being contacted by Apple Portugal, I contact US support and a few troubleshooting steps later, the technician concludes with 100% certainty that my touchbar has to be replaced... Not only that, but since the replacement is out of warranty, it would cost me $1475 because the whole upper part of my latop had to be replaced - much like the keyboard replacement program.Again: my \"not 3 year\" Apple Care+ had just ended, like, 20 days prior to this. Murphy\\'s Law at its best...I ask if I can send it to be repaired under the keyboard replacement program, but no \"the device has to have proven keyboard issues to be repaired under that program\", which made me seriously consider shoving dirt under the keys just to cause an issue with the keyboard and have it repaired for free.At this point, I\\'m basically being punished for not having keyboard issues.However, once again, US service cannot help me any further because again: wrong country.I decide to live with a broken touchbar. It still worked, I just couldn\\'t see half of it and had to pretty much guess what I was pressing. I wasn\\'t going to invest 1500 bucks on a 2500 computer that I was still paying (loan).This was last month: I decided to reset the Macbook and upgrade it to Monterey and the touchbar issue resolved itself.Thank you Apple for the $1500 quote on a software issue.And thank you Apple Portugal for simply ignoring my existence (I have process numbers and proof of everything that happened).Anyway I hope my experience helps anyone who had/has issues with Apple, and particularly tech issues the touchbar on the A1990 2018 Macbook Pro and was told it would need to be repaired. Also it should serve as an eye-opener to Apple so they address the huge customer service problem here in Portugal.PS - I tried making a formal complaint in Apple forums and here\\'s their reply, after removing my post. Apparently censorship and silencing customers who have issues is considered good business practice:\"We removed your post Awful customer support in Portugal - Issue with touchbar because it contained rants or complaints that weren‚Äôt constructive.

Completely ridiculous as the phone is in my name and I pay for it. We got that resolved and they mailed me a box to send the phone in. They repaired it to send it back for it to have the same issue shortly after. I had to call to send it back in for a second time for the same issue. Within a month it was doing the same thing again. This time when I called in they said if it does the same thing after the third repair I will get a replacement phone. Well they will not fix the phone as they are claiming it now has water damage which is absolutely not true and if it does did not come from my end. The customer service person I talked to after calling in when I received the email claiming this agreed it was very strange they didn‚Äôt see water damage the first or second time they opened the phone but rather the third time and it has hit the year mark of owning the phone so there no longer are any warranties etc. They refused to help me and refused to let me talk to a manager and disconnected the call. I then emailed the CEO, CFO AND COO of Apple for neither of them to reach out but someone from their office to reach out. He claimed he was going to investigate this issue and get back to me. I asked him what I should do about the phone as I was unsure what would happen if I didn‚Äôt answer them about what to do with the phone. He said there should be a date that I have to answer by which was not specified anywhere on the email that I screenshot for him. He said he extended the time frame so I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry until this issue was resolved. A few days later I received an email from them saying they were sending the phone back to me I not repaired. I reached back out explaining my concern and he said he extended it so he was unsure as to why that happened. He then explained I would have an answer by the end of the week as to what the outcome will be. He reached back out two days later and told me they will not be replacing the phone as the technician shown there was water damage and disregarded everything else. When I asked him to speak with someone higher than him as he seemed to not care either he told me I could not speak to anyone else as he was assigned to the case and this is the final result. Apple is the absolute worst and they are very sad people to treat customers the way they do by lying to them, hanging up on them, not resolving any of their issues, as well as not acting if they got ripped off or taken care of. I would never recommend Apple products to anyone and as soon as I can get the money I will be switching all of our laptops, phones etc over to Samsung and taking out business elsewhere that is not so greedy and rude!', 'Worst phone ive ever had.

At first, the issue was sporadic, but it quickly escalated to a point where it became unbearable. After researching online, I discovered that this was a widespread issue affecting all models featuring the 'new butterfly type keyboard' introduced in 2015. This keyboard has caused a lot of problems, especially regarding the issue I encountered. A quick search online reveals endless complaints, and it's gotten so bad that Apple has officially acknowledged the problem and created a fix, in addition to settling a $50 million dollar class action claim for the very same issue.When I went to the Apple Genius Bar at Chadstone, I met with Dave, who visually and physically examined my MacBook Pro and suggested that the issue was  probably some dirt stuck under the key. But after five minutes, Dave returned with a wry smile and told me that the key was broken. He quickly added that it would be too expensive to fix at AUD$1000 and it wasn't worth it. The key was no longer stuck, but it was broken. I confronted Dave, and he said that all he did was blow compressed air under the key.I spoke to the store manager and asked him to review the CCTV footage of our interactions. After seeing it, he agreed with everything I claimed. But, he maintained that all Dave did was wipe the keyboard with a cloth and blow compressed air. I asked the manager if he agreed that the H key looked damaged and broken, sitting lower than any other key on the keyboard, and he said it did. So, I asked why Dave didn't identify it during the initial inspection. The manager then offered to split the damage bill 50/50, but I declined and reported the issue to Apple directly the next day.Apple Australia responded, but their response was disappointing. They sided with the Apple Store staff regarding this matter. It's frustrating to encounter such a widespread known issue, and even more disappointing to receive such an unsatisfactory response from Apple Genius Chadstone, refusing to take responsibility for making my initial well publicised butterfly keyboard fault claim  null and void by completely breaking the keyboard and leaving me in the hole with at least a $500 repair bill which they kindly accepted a partial responsibility for their negligence.

It is now having arrogant business owners scam buyers into buying products costing an arm and a leg with planned obsolescence harming Earth's environment and working class people's financial stability. The new iPhones no longer have a headphone jack. New Macs and iPhones have notches that make using specific apps like Netflix a pain to use. Privacy became a joke when Apple had governments have backdoor access to people's devices. Because Apple is headquartered in America, that country is an enemy to online privacy from mass surveillance. So, this is just another cut-throat corporation controlled by an Orwellian oligarchy. Especially when Chinese slave labor from China's dehumanizingly collectivistic country makes products that get sent to greedy Americans.\", \"These guys are the best in the market at present, really enjoy using the iPad and the iPhone which was their best foot forward in the right direction.

It seemed like it had a hard drive failure and the apple operator made an appointment for me to take it into their Apple authorized reseller store Simply Mac at the Avenues in Marrietta, GA.  It was supposed to take 3 to 4 days to diagnose the problem then let me know what the repair would entail.  I tried to call the store on June 10th to get an update, but I got a recording that they were busy and to leave a message.  The same thing happened on June 11th so I drove to the store that day.  It turns out that the Simply Mac store had gone out of business and June 9th and no one called me to notify me to pick up my computer.  The rental office of the mall could not open the shop for me to retrieve my computer because the Simply Mac had filed for bankruptcy and it was in litigation.  The rental office gave me the number of the bankruptcy attorney in Salt Lake City.  I called him and he tried to help but said he was being ghosted by Apple and the landlord.  I have made repeated calls to Apple support since June 11th and they could only say that I should wait for an email from Apple.  I kept calling Apple, the mall rental office  and the attorney every two weeks because I nevery received an update regarding my iMac.  I finally I received a call from Apple support today August 24th, 2022 telling me that the representative/partner who emptied the store cannot locate my computer.  So basically, my computer has been stolen from a store that was recommended to me by Apple Support.  The apple agent who emptied the store, will not return my calls or answer my emails. I was advised to contact Simply Mac attorney and file a claim. Attorney sent forms but mentioned that I may never be compensated or if I did it may be years.  How ridiculous is that?  I believe this warrants a call to All local news stations.

I called Apple they said this was a known issue and would likely replace the screen for free upon inspection.  They sent me to a Best Buy store to get it repaired two days later. Best Buy said they'd have to charge me for it and they weren't sure why Apple would have sent us to Best Buy given they had to get paid for the work being done. They recommended I go back to Apple and schedule and appointment at the Genius Bar. To say I was disappointed that Apple was dishonest and also sent me on my Sunday to the wrong place that was unable to repair the defective phone without charging me was frustrating.I called Apple and was put in touch with a supervisor.

Thinking I could just make an appointment on their website, something a tech giant should be able to figure out, I was met with a security screen that asked for me to log into my Apple ID to make an appointment. To my surprise, my quest for getting a new phone required a verification code sent to my phone that I was trying to fix. I then had my dad call to make an appointment so that I could get in as soon as possible.  So today I went in and got my new phone. After paying over 1000$ I left the store only to find out that they again had changed the charging port for the usb but this time the other end and made me return to buy a wall port that could accommodate it. So more money down the drain. Once my phone was charged, it asked me to log onto my Apple ID which yet again, required me to put in a verification code sent to a phone that won‚Äôt turn on. At this point, I don‚Äôt know if Apple even knows what technology is supposed to do: Make life easier for people. After a lot more back and forth and getting no where, I was being told to buy another thing. At this point, I told them that if they don‚Äôt get this phone open, I was returning the phone and getting an android. It was only until then that they finally got me a working phone.

I had to call Paybright several times to ensure that a refund was coming.All the while my available credit on the Credit card was showing a debit of $2000 which I couldn't use for other purchases.

The Apple consultant said I could mail the phone in for repairs but it would cost $756. I asked her how do you know how to charge if you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with the phone? I also had the battery replaced and paid $159. The phone continued to drain to the point that after 3 hours the phone would shutdown at night time it had to be left plugged in. On numerous occasions I told the Apple customer service people I suspected the IOS updates 16.4 to have done something to the phones battery. Apple-vehemently denied this. I also discovered friends, family and strangers to be suffering the same with their phones. In some cases people bought new phones. Last week there was an update 16.6 incredibly like a miracle my battery issue‚Äôs disappeared overnight. Was Apple testing me and others our patience to see if we would pay for a $756 repair or buy a new $1399 iPhone in the belief that our iPhones life was over. You be the judge to me this is coercion. As it is I have lost time and aggravation and $159 for nothing.What‚Äôs worse is that when I posted a warning to other users on Apple Support Community my post was removed. I have taken my case up with consumer affairs and encourage others to do the same.', \"Ordered a MacBook Air on July 14th and was given a delivery date of between 5th and 12th August. As I was doing photo editing for a Photo Exhibition for Children's Cancer I wasn't too concerned as I had my iPad Pro. Then last week it packed up so I rang Apple to ask if my MacBook could be got to me any quicker due to the fact of the Children's Cancer. I was told by the lady I spoke to that she would put in an Urgent request to her box to get me my MacBook. That never happened either she never pass it on or Apple couldn't be bothered. So yesterday the 9th they dispatched my MacBook by DHL, it arrived at my local depot this morning the 10th at 0733 but DHL won't deliver it until Thursday 11th WHY!! I've no idea. I rang Apple to be told they can't do anything to help me as it was with the courier and they do what they want. I asked if they could ring DHL but they refused, Apple just don't care not only about their customers but also Children who have Cancer. They could have least had the decency to speed up the delivery of my MacBook considering the circumstances for what I was using it for, they are a total disgrace I just hope none of their children get cancer, they are a disgrace to humanity.\", 'It‚Äôs the most durable and reliable gadget I have used all my life, Love it.

I accidentally broke my tablet, which I just assumed I was out of luck. I never had good experience with insurance actually replacing anything. Apple care plus replaced my tablet within a day. The people I talked to on the phone and chat were super helpful, right to the point.

Apple swear blind that these were authorised by an iPhone 6 that belonged to my daughter. I took the phone, switched it off and locked it a my safe....the unauthorised activity continued for a while until I removed the iPhone 6 and my payment method from the account. A few payments were refunded, then the money taken back for most of them, leaving me ¬£170 out of pocket. A few months later it started up again. No payment method had been entered on the account and yet my debit card was chaged another ¬£169. This would have been much higher if I had not alerted my bank and had payments to Apple blocked. Apple Support was useless. Their agent Noel even put forward the theory that someone was accessing my Apple account, despite me changing the password several times and adopting 2 stage verification, entering my debit card details, making purchases, then deleting the debit card number until the next time. I asked how this was possible given the 2 stage verification, frequent change of password etc.No explanation was offered. I next spoke to Marcel who had a further bizarre theory that my daughter's old phone may have been cloned. This still did not answer the tricky question of getting past the 2 stage verification on my account. Next I was put through to a manager called Nicky. She was  sympathetic and superficially helpful. It turns out that Apple refund requests are not dealt with by humans but by an algorithm. In my case one refund would be approved and the next 6 denied. In classic Little Britain fashion 'the computer says no'. All Nicky could do was to suggest I take it up with my bank. Apple plays snakes and ladders with banks, giving money back with one hand, when challenged, then recharging the account a few days later when the computer says no again. It is like communicating with the members of some strange cult whose sole aim is to relieve you of your hard earned money. I have lost count of the number of hours I have wasted over this issue in the past 4 months. It seems that Apple banks on you giving up any refund claim or suggestion that their system is not secure, through shere frustration.

Long story short, delivery box was sealed but there was no phone, no packaging even, inside the sealed brown box.

I strongly urge you to reconsider purchasing any Apple product or Apple Care within the country. The level of service provided is abysmal, to say the least, and it is disheartening to witness the complete lack of accountability, especially when it comes to warranty claims.Let me provide you with an account of my own ordeal. Despite my AirPods Pro being well within the warranty period and experiencing a manufacturing issue, the service center deliberately delayed addressing the problem until the warranty had expired. It has been a relentless battle since April, continuously following up with them, only to be met with empty promises and a complete disregard for proper tracking and skilled technicians. Astonishingly, major cities lack dedicated Apple service centers, and instead, rely on third-party facilities. Even if your product is under warranty, don't expect a replacement, as you would in the US or UK.Adding insult to injury, the treatment received from Apple's service personnel is utterly disrespectful, as if owning a premium product does not warrant attention or respect. It bewilders me that there seems to be a lack of a proper tracking mechanism within Apple's international care system. It appears that no matter the exorbitant amount one may spend on an Apple product in India, even if it requires repairs the very next day or if a manufacturing defect arises, one might as well consider it a lost cause. Offering them a year for service or expecting a replacement is futile.If you happen to be reading this, I implore you to heed my words and refrain from purchasing an Apple product in India. I have personally suffered the consequences of my hard-earned money going to waste. I encourage you to explore various forums on Apple in India, where you will find countless individuals grappling with similar issues regarding Apple's service standards. Unless you manage to escalate your concerns to Apple's international care team, the situation in India is unlikely to change. Protect your finances by avoiding Apple products in the Indian market.\", 'Was given Airpods for Christmas, really liked them however didn‚Äôt get much use out of them because of Covid.

The store said they could see water damage and that I would have to pay ¬£65 per pod to replace. I explained that I have not had them long and hardly used them, only for gym.  They said that sweat from the gym can cause it.  Given my previous issues with them and that I have hardly used them, I spoke to customer service who said there was nothing they could do and that I would have to pay that to either fix them or get new ones.

I am shocked that after 3 months of having this new pair that ‚Äúwater damage‚Äù can impact them from occasional gym usage. If this is the case, then this should be made clear in their advertising. It also should not be ¬£65 each to repair them (they said this would be the cost without actually looking at the issue properly).

I said my problem is with iCloud and gave her my Mac serial number , then she said we chatted about an iPad , so she couldn't help. this conversation had gone on very long with her not reading or understanding my problem, and sending more links that had nothing to do with my issue. I told her I would report her and she sent a link for feedback about apple products not service. I hung up on her and scheduled a call back myself on the site which I had asked her to do. I made screenshots of our conversation and I intend to take this further because she did not offer any help at all and she did not try to understand the problem, and she refused to even schedule a call back. while being very rude. she kept talking about my job, I told her my job uses dell, it has noting to do with my apple iCloud and she replied that she had worked with dell. I said I hope now you are working with apple and that you will try to help me. But she sent another link showing hoe to reset my password. This wasted about 2 hours or more of my time and was absolutely unacceptable. I had also told her that I was trying to do a factory reset but it wouldn't take and she sent me a link to permanently delete everything from my I cloud. I said I did not want that . she was just an awful waste of time. Meanwhile someone was hacked into my iCloud and controlling it. I have screenshots if anyone is interested.

It was in stock and it was supposed to be delivered on the following day, Friday, July 22. UPS picked it up from Apple in Chicago on Friday at 9:22 AM. We live in downtown Chicago. You\\'d think it would be an easy delivery, no? Well, you\\'d be wrong. We didn\\'t get it on Friday. Apple did collect the $923.56 from my wife on Saturday. But we didn\\'t get the phone on Saturday or Sunday either. On Monday July 25 I checked our order status at the Apple Store online. It said: \"Shipment on hold. There is an issue with your delivery and the carrier is unable to deliver your package. Please contact us at 1-800-MY-APPLE.\" Come again??? We live in downtown Chicago, about 1.4 miles from the Michigan Avenue Apple Store. We get deliveries from UPS all the time. There\\'s a doorman in our lobby twenty-four hours seven days a week. But UPS is unable to deliver our package? That\\'s very interesting. What happened? We\\'d love to know more.We checked the UPS website. They had updated their tracking information. It said they\\'d deliver the package by 7:00 PM that evening. We waited till past 7:00 PM. They didn\\'t. We called Apple. There was a nice lady who looked into it for us. She took a lot of notes. She said they had no idea what was going on. They would start an investigation. But we should call UPS, too. We called UPS. It took about twenty minutes before we managed to get past the automatic dragon lady who won\\'t let you talk to a human being unless you have a magic key. We spoke to a nice lady who looked into it for us. She said they couldn\\'t tell us anything. We weren\\'t the shipper. They can only talk to the shipper. We should ask Apple to start an investigation. We told her we already had. She said we should be patient. On Tuesday July 26 we called Apple again. We spoke to a nice man. He looked into it for us. He read all of the notes and took some more notes. He said he saw the problem. But he had no updates. We should be  patient. They have a process. It needs to run its course. We would hear from them no later than two days after they started the investigation. We didn\\'t. Today it\\'s Thursday July 28, a week since we placed the order, six days since it was shipped, five days since our money was collected. We still haven\\'t heard from Apple. But UPS did update their tracking information a while ago. It says that \"the delivery date will be provided as soon as possible.\" Apparently it wasn\\'t possible on Tuesday. It wasn\\'t possible on Wednesday either. Apparently it\\'s still not possible today. Can you believe it? We paid more than $900 for an Apple iPhone that was supposed to arrive six days ago. It must be somewhere in Chicago don\\'t you think? But where? When will we get it? Apple isn\\'t able to locate it? Can\\'t track it with some global-corporate equivalent of the \"FindMy\" app technology that works so well to track my son and my wife? UPS can\\'t locate it either? Somebody doesn\\'t know how to scan a bar code? The dog ate the paper? The driver got sick? \"It fell off the truck\"? I guess it serves us right for trusting Apple and UPS that $923.56 would be enough to make them do their job. We should have walked to the Apple Store and picked it up in person. It\\'s only half an hour walk away. But we got Covid ten days ago. We\\'re still recovering. We ought to be patient. So we\\'re whiling away our time on the web and on the phone.

As all my data was transferred from my old iPhone and I chose dark mode to protect my eyes, I did not notice there is a faulty pixel on my iPhone 13pro at the top left corner. It‚Äôs very difficult to notice because of the black margin of Apple screen. Lately when I change to the light mode, I see it and call Apple service to seek for the replacement as I am still in warranty. But the customer service ask me to diagnose it with a technician appointed by them. I have to drive one hour to go to the service store, but they can not diagnose it only if I leave this phone to them two days. I would not like to leave my phone cuz I will have no phone to use and I will have to drive back to get it, and the technician guy said they might only change the screen after open and check the phone.My iPhone is working well and brand new condition but with a small faulty black pixel on, I do not need more damage to the phone merely because it has a faulty pixel. So I called Apple service again to tell them the issue and ask for direct replacement because I did nothing wrong for this faulty product from them. They admit this faulty pixel might caused by the faulty hardware, or it might be caused by the software. Neither of the reasons was my fault, but according to their terms if I purchased an Apple product, I need to suffer all these troubles their faulty product caused. They will not replace it if I do not drive to the service store several time and let them open my iphone so them can find out what caused the faulty pixel even if I did not misuse.Apple causes so many troubles for customers to give up seeking for their right to get a good product in warranty time. I do not wanna to risk to get a broken phone after I got a faulty product.

What i cannot stand about Apple products though is that perfectly good products are killed off by software updates. It doesn't matter if you personally look after your product and keep it in perfect condition because software updates will come along and destroy older products.  My current iphone is currently being affected by what I have been told are Battery Bugs. The phones battery percentage goes up and down all over the show and then switches itself off for no reason. This is infuriating for someone who has spent a lot of money on Apple products, believing that if I looked after the product then it would last me a long time, apparently not, it lasts as long as Apple want it to, then it is killed off with updates.My iphone is more than just a phone to me because it monitors my blood sugars via a Dexcom One blood sugars monitoring device that i wear. I need my iphone to keep track of what is happening to my blood sugars and then suddenly a good battery percentage reduces to 1% and the phone then shuts itself off leaving me not knowing what is going on inside my body.It personally feels like they kill off old products on purpose with these updates to force you to update your product and spend more money with them.For a company that is so big, you would expect better.\", \"Most people complain about Apple but still have an iPhone, iPad etc.  Most problems arise from not understanding how to use these devices therefore most people complain about what is essentially their own error in not backing up the device properly before updating etc.  I use Apple devices for business and the way iCloud syncs is brilliant! They are simple to use, easy and very user friendly! I've also found their customer service to be of a very high standard too. Of course it has its problems but nothing is perfect but I'd never go back to anything Windows again if I could help it. MS anything is clunky, slow, updates every two mins when you least need them when needing to finish an important report etc. Plus a nightmare to back up and restore! Why can't everything be as simple as Apple! Technology should be fun, not require a degree in rocket science to work first. Yes they are expensive and work needs to be done to make things more affordable but hats off to apple for making computing fun and stylish again. It's actually a pleasure to work with Apple devices.\", 'I bought an IPad Air and after 3 weeks it will not charge. Contacted Apple and they wanted a credit card number to replace IPad.

I told them if you can‚Äôt trust me to send it back, I can‚Äôt trust you to refund my payment. I have been dealing with Verizon since 1995 and they will not send a cable that was bad to begin with without a deposit. Why should I take a chance and pay for something that was bad when I purchased it. For people that can not drop everything and go to Verizon(30+ round trip) when you are retired.  Whatever happened to customer service. It is all about the money and greed. I had to get another adapter and not from Apple. Do not deal with Apple.

So, with that in mind, congrats Apple on your successful execution of this, your aftercare is somewhat vulgar and certainly not a polished service.

The pro max is almost like a little iPad, it‚Äôs got decent enough screen estate to do most work stuff and it‚Äôs great for watching movies or streaming your favourite series (the aspect ratio and proportions of the screen is much better than Samsung as there is better width, so better portrait immersion as well as in landscape, other phones like Samsung seem to favour a weird narrow style), and the sound quality from the speakers is wonderful IMO. The quality of engineering in this device is simply brilliant. The user experience is seamless and intuitive which is exactly what I like, all your services are integrated in the Apple ecosystem, but you can access other services if you want.

The instructions used to be clearer, and the staff was more adept at addressing my questions and concerns. Unfortunately, it seems that the quality of customer service in this regard has declined.I hope that Apple takes steps to ensure smoother communication with customers and provides clearer instructions in the future.

When I came back, they tell me they discovered some unexpected water damage in the phone (which I assume could have come from showing the QR-code for the Genius bar appointment outside - it was raining and I had a cracked screen after all..).The problem: After the \"repair\" half of the screen of the before-perfectly-working phone now doesn\\'t work anymore, which makes the phone practically unusable. They say I need to replace the complete phone for 99‚Ç¨, which I find disappointing, but am willing to do. However they don\\'t actually have a phone in the store and I should come back in 2-3 days to get and pay for my replacement.So effectively they\\'re telling me: Sorry, but please get lost with a phone that we completely broke and live without a phone for 2-3 days. Obviously this is a problem / impossible in today\\'s world for both work and personal life!So I ask for a replacement phone for the 2-3 days: Nope.I ask whether the other Apple Store in the city (far away) could help me: They cannot say and won\\'t even tell me whether they have a phone in store, but expect me to just go and hope. They refuse to call and ask them, because it\\'s not the policy.I ask to speak to the store manager: They send someone who tries to pretend to be the store manager, who tells me to just accept it.I ask for the real store manager: A women called Ulrike (she refuses to tell me her last name) comes and claims to be the real store manager. I explain the situation and she just says there is nothing she can do (including not connected me with someone higher up, who could solve the problem).At this point I\\'m actually just very confused and sad.

I was very happy until, out of the blue, it failed completely on 14th December 2022 in the middle of a Teams call. I was not able to restart it. I contacted Apple who ran through some basic diagnostics and advised me to take it to an authorised repairer. I was told that my iMac was out-of-warranty as it was more that 1 year old, the implication being that I would need to pay for a repair.I delivered it to an iStore in Guildford on 16th December 2022.On the 20th December 2022 the iStore informed me that in addition to the ¬£90 diagnostic fee I had already paid I would need to pay ¬£475 for a new Logic Board.This seemed outrageous for a product that was 18-months old. On reviewing my rights as a consumer I wrote to Apple. The letter included the following:The Consumer Rights Act 2015 makes it an implied term of the contract I have with Apple that goods be as described, fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality.As you are in breach of contract and I've owned the product between 6 months and 6 years, I am within my statutory rights to ask for it to be repaired.The reply came back that I had sent this to the wrong place in Apple and I should contact Apple Care.22 December 2022 - I speak to an advisor - John - who assures me he will take ownership and resolve the issue for me. He sounds very uncertain and hesitant when he learns that I am referencing consumer rights law to require Apple to pay for the repair. However, he eventually gives the iStore the go-ahead to complete the repair. He sends me a link to a site that allows me to leave a message and /or voicemail for him if I need further help.6 January 2023 - iStore inform me that they have tried various ways to fix the iMac but nothing works. They are at a loss as to how to repair it. I contact John via the link he has sent me but get no response.8 January 2023 - I call Apple Support and speak to Daniela who assures me she understands how frustrating this is and she will now take ownership of the case and resolve my issue. At this stage I ask for a like-for-like replacement of the iMac since it appears to be impossible to repair. She needs to talk to another department in Apple to see if this can be done but as they do not work on weekends cannot progress it further. She promises to call me the next day.9 January 2023 - Daniela calls and says that she has confirmed with the iStore that they do not know how to repair it. She tells me that I need to collect the faulty iMac from the iStore and when I have it to let her know so that she can see if the machine can be replaced. When I question why I need to collect it to send to them rather than have the iStore send it to them and why she could not guarantee that it would be exchanged, her response was that this is how we do things and there can be no deviation from that.10 January 2023 - I call the iStore to arrange to collect the faulty iMac the following day.11 January 2023 - The iStore text me to say that they are not sure that they can have the iMac reassembled in time to collect that day. I contact Apple Support to express my frustration with the process. I speak to Paulo who assures me he understands my frustration and that he will now take ownership and resolve my problem. When I insist that I need progress on the replacement he proceeds to process a like-for-like replacement order even though I do not yet have the iMac in my possession. He asks me to ensure the iStore repair order completion is sent to him stating that the device is not repairable. While talking to him a text comes through telling me that the iMac is ready for collection from the iStore. I pick up the faulty iMac and the iStore immediately volunteer a refund of the ¬£90 diagnostic fee (well done iStore!) and send me the repair order completion.

Worst thing is that it is extremely difficult to feedback to Apple as it is probably the most arrogant company in the world. I recently brought in my iPhone to the Apple shop in The Hague to replace the battery, not cheap but at least it's done properly one would think. But I got the phone back and the screen protector was removed without informing me. When I said that I wasn't too happy about that, the answer was that that was needed. I said I was not informed and like to make a complaint, that was not possible! Seriously, not possible, the arrogance. And when the obligatory follow up mail came and I said I was not happy, the option came if I wanted to be contacted by the shop... uh yes please... that never happened! Another thing is that after a month, the battery last even shorter than the old battery!

I don\\'t have any Apple products or services and no accessible accounts so couldn\\'t understand the charge.The only thing I can think is that I signed up for EE Broadband and Mobile some time ago. EE completely messed up so I cancelled under the 14 day cooling of period. Part of the EE offer was free Apple TV or Music (I can\\'t remember which) for X number of months. I took advantage of this offer for maybe two days, until I cancelled the EE services. Upon cancelling the EE services I also lost access to the Apple TV or Music. I am assuming that Apple mistakenly thought I was still on a free trial that has now expired and that this was a valid charge??After losing access I never gave it another thought until the charge occurred on my credit card.After the charge occurred, I found the only valid Apple account I had was one where my phone number was the username. Every time I tried to log in with that username, Apple wanted me to change the username to an email address and every time I entered one Apple said \"an error has occurred and wouldn\\'t let me go any further. But I could see, but couldn\\'t change or access, that that account had access to my credit card (I could see the last four digits). There was nothing else I could do - I couldn\\'t log-in and therefore I couldn\\'t see any orders or charges and I couldn\\'t cancel or change anything.I\\'d had no prior notification of the charges and as far as I could ascertain this was daylight robbery - someone had taken my money without my permission.

I have since replied for a second time asking what is happening and I have still heard nothing. It seems I am being ignored on purpose.Apple, illegally, stole ¬£6.99 off me and I want it back. I also want confirmation that they won\\'t be trying to charge me anymore and that they have closed down all my inaccessible accounts. I don\\'t have any need for their products and services and after this is resolved, I don\\'t want anything to do with them ever again.I have had to cancel my credit card over this and have had to lodge a complaint with my CC provider over this unauthorised transaction as Apple have not assisted at all.I have upset my managers at work over this by refusing to use the ¬£800 iPad Pro they have just given me and five other colleagues for a project.

I lost the charging case for my Airpods Pro 2 yesterday. Alternatively I tried to charge my Airpods Pro 2 in the charging case of my older Airpods Pro 1. That didn't work.

But after checking my bluetooth connection on my phone for the Airpods Pro 2, the customer support employees discovered that this was the exact same serial number as from my Airpods Pro 1. The fact that I tried to charge my Airpods Pro 2, in the charging case of my Airpods Pro 1, automatically changed the serial number of the Airpods Pro 2 on my iPhone, to the serial number of the Airpods Pro 1. The customer support insisted that they needed the serial number before I could buy a new charging case. But there was no way for them to find that serial number. I called with Bol.com, where I bought the Airpods 2. They also could not tell me what the serial number is. I have the original receipt from Bol.com, but that also does not mention the serial number. The 2 serial numbers from the Left and Right Airpods Pro 2 itself, were still visible on my iPhone. But the customer support said they could not use those serial numbers to find the serial number from charging box, because the charging box has a separate serial number. So I asked them how are we going to resolve this. I need a new charging case, otherwise I cannot use my Airpods Pro 2, and I need them for work next week. They refused to sell me a charging case. They kept repeating that they need that serial number. The serial number I don't have. Because Apple changes the serial number on my iPhone if I put the Airpods in another charging case. How was I suppose to know that. Half of the employees of the 'Genius Bar' did not know that. Then the manager tried to put the blame in my shoes, that I would been better if I made the purchase with them directly, and not with Bol.com (one of the biggest retailers in NL) + that I should not have put the Airpods Pro 2 in the Airpods Pro 1 charging case. Even half of their Genius Bar support staff was unaware of this fact. How was I suppose to know this, they look exactly the same! I said that I wanted to hear a solution from them. That just saying we cannot help you is not a solution. They offered me a minor discount on a new set of Airpods, which costs ~300 euro. Instead of a new charging case, which cost 120 euro. Totally unacceptable. It is the extreme arrogance and complete unwillingness to find a suitable solution for a customer that really sticks. They think they can be really arrogant and give dreadful service because they have a monopoly. I just looked Apple up here on Truspilot, to see what other people's experiences are with Apple.

Recontacted support to complain and again very polite and we will escalate. Never heard anything back afterwards.', 'Love my new iPhone 12! Perfect', 'Always used apple products from the 3G to now having the iPhone 12 Pro. I also have air pods pro, Apple Watch Series 7, air tag on my wallet. Absolutely no issues whatsoever. And if I do have issues the staff are amazingly helpful. Can‚Äôt complain. Will continue to use apple products!!', 'Ordered a phone with finance, Took a hit on my credit score for applying for finance only for them to fail to deliver the product, of course after 4-5 contacts they now tell me they have canceled the order and the credit agreement will be canceled to but still leaves me with a sour taste after i took such a hit for trying, My advice dont do credit with Apple as they may not deliver your purchased phone, Id be a lot more upset if they had not delivered something bought with cash but still terrible experience and Apple should be ashamed.', 'Great products, well impressed with my iphone 4 xxx', 'I would like to share my experience today. I was trying to help an elderly couple I know to get their Apple internet connection fixed on a laptop and tablet. Since I am far from savvy when it comes to technology (I would also be considered elderly) I called the support number. Tyler was extremely helpful, patient, and respectful. I allowed him to take control of the laptop and he guided me through the necessary steps, including recovering or changing passwords. Since things are so connected together it fixed both devices. I realize with this health crisis we are in now many businesses are struggling, but I would hope that when things return to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù his hard work and dedication would be rewarded.', 'Great manufacturer, perfect design and performance of all its products and I tried many.', 'I have a macbook that I spent $500 extra for 3 year protection plan that was supposed to cover all repairs and if they couldn‚Äôt they would replace the computer. I tried to send it in for repairs and before they even got it, they tried to charge me like $200. I am furious with this company. I have an iphone and apple watch too. Bought them all in november of 2020. I will NEVER buy another Apple product again as long as I live. They are a scam company selling products that cost way more than they‚Äôre worth. They use the same factories in China that every other company uses. I will be switching to Microsoft OS and buying an msi computer next time I purchase. I either want my $500 back or my $1600 laptop repaired like the Apple care plan I paid for said. Pathetic. If Steve Jobs were still alive and had any say of the company he would be appalled by their terrible customer service.', 'poop haha poopy stinky', 'My second bad review. My umpteenth bad experience with Apple. So ‚Ä¶. After I wrote about my experience in trustpilot and wrote to financial analysts and shareholders I got an email from a manager called ‚Äú Ruth‚Äù telling me she‚Äôs wants to speak with me and ‚Äú In store all Managers are fully accountable for customer complaints. If you would like to speak to a Manager for further clarity we would be more than happy to call you,‚Ä¶‚Äù But the sad reality/ no follow through. Two weeks later - still no one at Apple gives a toss. Absolutely rubbish customer focus. I asked for my recorded calls and they selectively sent the ones  and withheld the calls in which their agents have admitted they are at fault. Terrible is the only word.', 'mentioned a student apple music suscription will give a free flex earbuds, but no response or email instructions to claim this offer even after 3 months. Waste of time and purchasing apple music', 'On the 12 of September I bought online a MacBook Pro.  I received later an email with a tracking number that the item was shipped.  The tracking showed that the computer was assembled and shipped from Shanghai.  After few days in Shanghai, it went to Osaka Japan, and today, it is at Anchorage Alaska.  And I don‚Äôt know where else it will go before it gets to Montreal.  I can‚Äôt believe that a company  like Apple, who wants us to believe that they want to go carbon free and they care about the environment can‚Äôt assemble a computer in Canada and reduce the time for delivery and most important, reduce the impact on the environment.  I am very disappointed with Apple, and next time I will think twice before I order something from them.', 'They hid an app then after they charged me for a years subscription the app magically appeared in my subscriptions.Trying to get a refund is all automated and apparently no human can make the decision! Totally fraudulent and therefore untrustworthy.After phoning Apple I am told by a manager called Abigail that Apple did not charge me, and they don‚Äôt have the money to refund me!! BS and lies when asking why the app wasn‚Äôt visible until after they defrauded me, they abruptly put the phone down.I am now selling all Apple products and will never return!', \"Mac's, iphone, or tablets, like the old time saying goes: You get what you pay for. For this reason is why I own all of the above three apple products. Set up for all of the apple products are easy and if you do need assistance the choices are abundant. Customer service is top notch. Online, on the phone or at an Apple Store near you.\", 'I still don`t get why there are so many haters of Apple hardware. I`m a Macbook user since 2015, starting with Air, than Pro, and now with Pro M2, and for me it is a complete working machine. The last one I`ve ordered throught apple.com, and thanks to support they`ve helped me a lot, during choosing process. I`ve asked delivery to local AppStore, and it takes around 3 weeks.', 'Apple doesn‚Äôt care about the quality of their products. It‚Äôs a total scam. They make them to where they only last 2 years then you have to but another SUPER expensive piece of junk. The iPhones are only getting worse, and they are doing it on purpose. They don‚Äôt care about the customers, it‚Äôs all a money scam. Someone I know has an Apple iPhone 7 that still works fine, yet my iPhone 13 only lasted 2 years.', \"I see bad reviews on apple and am a bit confused. I lost my iphone today on my ebike phone holder and went to apple 'find my phone' it was amazing!!! It told me to within a couple hundred feet where my phone was. High fives to apple and apple support. You got my attention as far as being the tech giant I thought you were. I'm an apple guy for life.\", \"I've been a loyal Apple user since 2009. Due to the sluggishness of my 2013 iMac, I decided to invest in a new 27-inch iMac in 2018, which set me back ¬£1,800 and guess what? Its performance has deteriorated significantly since then. Waiting for a webpage to load is like watching paint dry, don't even get me started on using applications! I recently purchased a used i7-8th gen PC for just ¬£100, and it outperforms my iMac in every way. It's faster and more responsive.I'm done with Apple. Done with their overpriced, underperforming junk.\", 'I pre Ordered the new iPad at the beginning of November ready for my son‚Äôs Christmas present, delivery started around 20th December, however Apple decided to cancel my order on the 5th December and didn‚Äôt even send an email to confirm this and it‚Äôs now 5 days before Christmas and I‚Äôm with a main present and not able to get hold of one from anywhere! If they had sent me an email I could have tried to get one from somewhere else, I will never order from Apple again!', 'Apple is by far the most illegitimate technology company in the world. Poor business practices and overpriced bits of plastic and metal. I like their OS but I hate them as a business. Very poor and pretty much steal unnecessary amounts of money off their own customers. They tried to sell an AUX port on a cable for god sake. A basic connection made to look like a innovative apple product. Complete rip off nonsense product.', 'Might just switch to android. Never thought I‚Äôd say that.', \"My macbook pro 2014  is loud when I open single tab or PS. I contacted Apple and they didn't do jack. I won't ever buy a apple product.\", \"Superior products in every way possible, especially when it comes to the MBPs and the Ipads. Second to none. However, the iPhones derailed quite significantly after Jobs's passing unfortunately. They have great cameras, but they're clunky, plastic-y and ugly nowadays. They were gems back in the day though. Still, iOs runs perfect, but I opted out of the new ones and keep using older versions. I'll probably never get a new iPhone or anything produced after 2019 or so. It's like buying a plastic brick that looks like a Samsung relative or something. Apple Store is a whole different beast, let's not go there. I don't like it at all. And I like Final Cut even less. That program has cost me months of my life, literally, and is probably one of the most hated softwares on the planet. Despite all this, all in all a very trustworthy company with many superior products.\", 'Recently I have bought iPhone 13 pro and I am really impressed by the camera quality. I had previously had earlier version of iPhone and then switched to Samsung, but decided to go back again to apple and I am really happy with this product.', \"I wish I could leave a 0 star review. Apple customer 'care' is BULL****. I had an issue I was constantly trying to resolve for 2 months. No 'customer care' employee could help - over phone or chat. I ended up driving over an hour and going into apple only to be screwed over further. **** APPLE AND ITS EMPLOYEES. They do nothing but waste your time and money. I have learned my lesson.\", \"Apple does not have a FRAUD plan in place! If you're account is hacked, they won't do anything about it! Spent 4 hours on the phone with them going in circles work no success, no help, and no result. Unacceptable and unethical! Hackers changed my birthday, password, and security questions. The security questions were changed to Chinese! Obvious red flag. They told me there's nothing I can do and that everything I had purchased on my account is gone as well as my itunes balance! They just gave all my info to China and refused to help me get it back!\", 'I tried many methods on YouTube but no video can amount to the fact that I was on the phone to a Really helpful person, I‚Äôm actually astounded that many of you have put in bad reviews since I‚Äôve had such a good customer experience. I have no apple care but I was still treated with the upmost respect and had my issue with my HomePod immediately troubleshot and up and running again thank you.', \"Apple doesn't allow reviews on their products, advertisements, and even YouTube so that customers can't see the abuse of data privacy and bad practices the company has. As per the stocks app, they now want to research use of the iPhone to detect depression. How are they going to accomplish this? The same way they were going to go through all your messages with their image scanning tools. Be wary of this monopoly.\", \"Very bad customer service. My apple 11 has stopped taking pictures and videos. I am told it is a software issue with apple. They refuse to replace the phone and say we will look into it, sorry for the inconvenience!! ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! Faulty software and they won't give me a new phone. They said anyone buying a new phone will have same problem!!\", 'Bought a $600 watch and they can‚Äôt even include a power adapter. What kind of crap is that!
